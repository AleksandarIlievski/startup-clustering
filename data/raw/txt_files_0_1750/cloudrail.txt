Managed OT to Cloud Connectivity
IIoT — Proving Value Fast & Easily Scale Afterward
 
 
Data for the Industrial IoT
CloudRail is a fully managed solution to acquire data from industrial environments, preprocess it locally and send it to any cloud — Plug&Play. CloudRail works for greenfield as well as brownfield applications. It uses industry standards like OPC-UA to connect modern equipment, while old machines are retrofitted with secondary sensors. A database of over 12.000 sensor definitions in combination with automated data normalization and device provisioning reduces the setup time for connecting a machine to the cloud from weeks to just hours.
Besides faster time to value for IIoT projects, CloudRail provides a cloud-based device management solution which allows enterprise customers to securely roll-out, manage, and update thousands of globally distributed edge devices.
