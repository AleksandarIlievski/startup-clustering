INDUSTRIAL 3D PRINTERS FOR LARGE-FORMAT ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
BigRep makes big, industrial 3D printers for big, full-scale parts (and even big batches of smaller parts).  Our commercial 3D printers are up to 1 m3 in build volume, which in fact is big enough to hold 2 baby elephants or equals the build volume of about 40 desktop printers! ​
​With a large 3D printer, you can advance your manufacturing  capabilities with 3D printed prototypes, jigs and fixtures, patterns and molds, and end-use parts.  Where size isn’t a limiting factor, BigRep industrial 3D printers are built to make you faster and more agile, getting your products to market ahead of the competition.   ​
ITERATE FAST. PRODUCE FASTER. GET TO MARKET FASTEST.
The BigRep PRO is a 1 m³ powerhouse 3D printer, built to take you from prototyping to production. It provides a highly scalable solution to manufacture end-use parts, factory tooling or more with high-performance, engineering-grade materials. Compared with other manufacturing and FFF printing solutions, the PRO can produce full-scale, accurate parts faster and at lower production costs.
