OUR COMMON GOAL IS CLEAN WATER - FREE OF MICROPLASTICS AND TOXINS
Every second, millions of microplastic particles enter our streams, lakes, and oceans. The plastic, along with adhering pollutants and toxins, enters the food chain with currently unknown consequences. If nothing is done now against the spread of microplastics, this problem will have a long-term negative impact on our quality of life, human and animal health, and global ecosystems.
OUR INNOVATIVE SYSTEM REMOVES UP TO 95% MICROPLASTICS FROM WASTEWATER
ECOFARIO has developed a new type of separation process that significantly reduces microplastics and the associated pollutants in waste water. The system is installed as an alternative to the 4th cleaning stage in sewage treatment plants.
THE HYDROCYCLONEThe ECOFARIO technology works without a filter, based on the principle of the hydrocyclone. This avoids previous procedural and economic disadvantages of microplastics filtration.
 
OUR TECHNOLOGY IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THAN CURRENT ALTERNATIVES
