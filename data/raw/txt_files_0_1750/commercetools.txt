How to easily migrate in 3 steps
01 
Build a migration roadmap
                                            List important milestones, deliverables and a timeline. There are 3 areas which are the basis for the roadmap: data, business logic and UI/UX.
                                        
02 
Extract, import and verify data
                                            Our extremely flexible data model allows for real-time updates to its structure. Extract the data you want, and import it into commercetools by calling the appropriate APIs.
                                        
03 
Customize your commerce
                                            Customize or build your own features and functionality using our easily extensible portfolio to create the exact commerce experience your business wants to give customers.
                                        
Initially, we were looking for an eCommerce solution to respond quickly and flexibly to changing customer requirements. We chose commercetools because the platform allows us to extend our microservice-based landscape with eCommerce capabilities. We are convinced that commercetools is a strong partner for our digital strategy.
