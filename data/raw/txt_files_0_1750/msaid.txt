OUR SOFTWARE
TRANSFORMING PROTEOMICS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
Powered by vast amounts of training data, we develop deep learning models for bottom-up proteomics and integrate them into innovative software solutions:
  +  INFERYS: The versatile deep learning framework  +  INFERYS Rescoring: The powerful AI-upgrade  +  CHIMERYS: The AI-driven intelligent search algorithm
OUR SERVICES
CUSTOM DEEP LEARNING MODELS 
Our generic deep learning framework provides the flexibility to expand our prediction capabilities and customize them to your needs, instruments, and infrastructure. 
DEEP LEARNING-BASED DATA ANALYSIS 
We have developed next-generation data analysis services that reliably identify up to three times more peptide-spectrum-matches than classical workflows.
CUSTOM IN-SILICO SPECTRAL LIBRARIES
Generating spectral libraries is cumbersome, expensive, and rarely comprehensive. Predicted spectral libraries can be generated for any peptide sequence and organism.
CONSULTING
With our long-standing expertise in proteomics and proteomic data analysis, we are the perfect partner to test, evaluate and improve your proteomics data workflows.
