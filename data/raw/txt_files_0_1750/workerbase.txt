Create a fully data-driven production environment to gain more resilience and save costs.Explore our playbook for the digital transformationIntelligent process execution platformThe current tough environment defined by global uncertainty, volatile market demand and ever new resource shortages has driven legacy systems to their limits. Trying to stick to long term production plans has become an unachievable goal. The requirements of today are to establish pragmatic solutions quickly and compensate for the volatility of supply and demand. Existing systems and methodologies are unable to deliver against this demand and this is where WORKERBASE helps you compensate. We upgrade your production environment in 4 simple steps in less than 4 weeks.ConnectConnect existing datasources, machines, ERP, MES or other systems.OrchestrateGuide human workers with digital work instructions and collect data from machine operation, assembly or quality assurance processes.UnderstandUnderstand production with real-time insights. Analyze the combined data, find root causes and make predictions.OptimizeOptimize production workflows in real-time and turn data into action.Dynamic Process Execution platformThe current tough environment defined by global uncertainty, volatile market demand and ever new resource shortages has driven legacy systems to their limits.

Navigate through the steps below to see how to connect yours systems, orchestrate your processes, understand the generated data and optimize the processes based on real-time data.1. Connect2. Orchestrate3. Understand4. OptimizeConnect your existing systems, machines and other data sourcesWe have designed a universal framework to connect to literally any system or data source. You can import your legacy files like Excel or Word documents, connect to databases you already maintain in other places or establish bidirectional interfaces with your ERP, MES, WMS, PLM or other systems. Connecting your machines can be achieved by connecting to their PLCs or in case your machines do not have any connectivity at all, you can retrofit them with readily available sensors.More about our connectivity to your existing systemsOrchestrate your workforce and collect crucial operational dataWorkforce orchestration is a key enabler to the agile factory. Your legacy systems typically struggle with producing an accurate view of the current production status. When your data is captured with legacy devices, paper sheets, Excel tables or MS Power Apps you are creating data silos that are hard to escape from. WORKERBASE collects operational data in real-time from any process by orchestrating the work using connected Workflow Apps that are able to run on any kind of device.More about real-time workflow managementRun real-time analysis and recommend process adaptationsOnce you combine Workflow Apps with your existing data, you are adding a level of contextual information that makes it very easy to identify root causes of any process disruptions. WORKERBASE collects all data in real-time and makes this data accessible for further analysis in a harmonized format. Using advanced AI algorithms, you are even able to derive recommendations for your staff on how to deal with certain situations and adjust processes to real-time needs.More about data-driven productionOptimize your production processes by turning your data into actionWhen you orchestrate your workforce with WORKERBASE you are not only able to collect crucial production data in realtime, you are also able to turn your data into action without further modification. Workflow Apps not only collect data, they also guide your workers through their tasks and therefore allow you to digitally steer your production flow. This means that the information you are deriving from your analysis and the respective system recommendations can immediately be put into action.
