This not only focuses on professional exchange, but also on social exchange within the team. In our opinion, this is essential for the general well-being and engagement of our employees."Susanne St√∂ckerCorporate Communication Representative - GESOBAU¬†AG"The feedback from colleagues who have participated in the coffee roulette has been consistently positive. Many have reported meeting colleagues who they did not or hardly knew before. The format is also very well received across hierarchies, prejudices were dismantled and fears taken away. From time to time, more colleagues participate in the coffee roulette, which shows us that some who were ambivalent towards the format at the beginning have developed a more open attitude towards it."Nina T√∂lkeHR Representative - Diamant Software GmbH"At Diamant Software, we value personal relationships between customers and employees.
