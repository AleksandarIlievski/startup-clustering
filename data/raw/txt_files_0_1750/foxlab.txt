A great tool to really practice the interview situation and in the end practice makes perfect. It is something completely different than just reading the questions somewhere and writing them down.

I have been browsing quite a while and nowhere else on the web have I found such a complete collection of questions and, above all, valuable tips on how to best answer the questions. Great content!
