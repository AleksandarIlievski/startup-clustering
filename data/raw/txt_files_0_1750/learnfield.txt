In the press
            ​Unlike various other music-learning apps, Skoove’s virtual guide takes the learner through each lesson, and provides real-time feedback that listens to the player as they practice.
        
            ​Eventually, notes, keys and names fall into place – I even play four suspiciously simple bars of Bach by sight! With both hands! Success!

I recently discovered Skoove and am really happy with my progress, learning a few bars to playing 'Lean on Me' in just a couple of days. I didn’t realise how musical I could be ;-).

I liked the fact that music theory is taught in an understandable way. It’s very intuitive and I can see myself achieving literacy with notes in the future - something I’d never imagined being able to do.

Amazing service, seriously! I was about to hire a home tutor to help me with notation and composition, but this feels quicker and easier.
