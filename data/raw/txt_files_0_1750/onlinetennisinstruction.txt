Why The OTI MethodIs So Effective
Personalized Video Feedback
Personalized video feedback is at the heart of The OTI Method. Whether you use one of our online training programs or you attend one of our OTI clinics, we will give you laser-focused feedback on your individual strokes. Our goal is to make improvement as simple as possible for you!
Improve Quickly Without Confusion
With our unique OTI analysis process we filter out only those elements of your strokes that once fixed result in better shots quickly.With this process we can avoid confusion from too much information, which is so common with standard technical instruction.

Highly Trained OTI Certified Instructors
Our instructors all have received intensive training in the OTI Method. They are among the best instructors in the tennis industry and can easily identify your technical problems and show you how to fix them.
Instant Video Feedback
If you train with our instructors in an OTI clinic, you will receive instant video feedback on the court.
This is incredibly powerful and only possible because we hire hitters and feeders so that the OTI instructor can be right next to you instead of on the other side of the net!

“The Serve Blueprint is amazing”
“The serve blueprint is amazing. Here is the ultimate proof: Other people noticed my improvements and are now asking me for tips to help them with their own serve!. With the help of Florian’s video courses, I have been able to elevate my game from between a 3.5 and 4.0 level to a very solid 4.5 level and am now working my way up to the 5.0 level!”
Mike Miller
Club Player
“The Serve Blueprint has totally transformed my serve!”
“Before the serve blueprint I was lucky to hold serve 20% of the time because I had a huge number of faults on that serve. Now I am getting 75-80% of my first serves in with good power and spin and I find myself holding serve closer to 75-80% of the time!”
Peter Forke
Club Player
“I have taken many tennis lessons in the past but only this video course really improved my serve!”
“I have taken many tennis lessons from different coaches over the last 30 years but this course taught me things I never heard before and it really worked for me! My first and second serves are much more consistent now!”

Michael Fitch

“Now I Am Nailing My Forehand Shots”
“I’ve been playing for 10 years and never had a strong forehand. Now I am nailing my forehand shots and my regular opponents are commenting on how much pace my forehand shots have and how heavy they are!”
Richard Isgard
Club Player
“With my forehand I never really knew if it would work when I walk on the court.”
After I looked at the videos, I did a lot of shadow practice and when I went on the court it really worked right away! My forehand is much more consistent and powerful. I definitely recommend that you try this online program.”
Onno Koelman
Club Player
“The videos showed me what a great modern forehand looks like and how I can develop it step by step.”
“I am a 4.5 player from California and the OTI forehand training videos helped me fix several problems I had with my forehand. The videos showed me what a great modern forehand looks like and how I can develop it step by step. I also had Golfer’s elbow because of my poor technique. Now I hit forehands with more depth and authority. My forehand simply feels great, and the elbow also feels great!”

Jeff Turk

“I had the pleasure of attendinga clinic with Nadim Naser in Solana Beach, CA. For 4 hours we dissected the main components of my game, with emphasis on my serve. I was particularly impressed with Nadim’s passion and expertise. I’m a visual learner, and the use of video feed back was very helpful throughout the instruction. Nadim was kind enough to email me video links of our session so I can continue to learn here at home.”
Rob

“My experience at a recent OTI Tennis Serve Clinic conducted by Nadim Naser was fantastic. With three participants, Nadim provided 5 hours of hands-on expert instruction on serve technique that included extensive video analysis of each participant”
