													RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT												
 
Adrenomed is dedicated to saving the lives of critically ill patients by translating the concept of personalized medicine to acute care. We are targeting Adrenomedullin, a peptide hormone with protective effects on endothelial barrier integrity. With a biomarker guided approach utilizing the target Adrenomedullin for patient selection, Adrenomed is developing a unique and holistic approach to rescue vascular integrity in life-threatening conditions such as sepsis and septic shock. 
ADRECIZUMAB
 
The Company’s lead product candidate is Adrecizumab (HAM8101; INN: enibarcimab), a clinical-stage, first-in-class drug targeting loss of vascular integrity. The strong rationale for Adrecizumab is supported by the elegance of its mode of action, a monoclonal antibody that on binding to its target Adrenomedullin preserves its functionality as regulator of vascular integrity.  
 
Adrecizumab mode of action 
Adrecizumab targets Adrenomedullin (ADM), a vasoprotective peptide hormone. As a small peptide, ADM can easily leave the bloodstream by crossing the endothelial barrier and entering the extravascular space, where it affects vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and regulates vascular tone by promoting vasodilation—an unwelcome effect in the context of sepsis as it contributes to increased hypotension and organ damage. ADM that remains in the bloodstream, however, has a different effect, one that helps mitigate sepsis: promoting stability of the endothelial barrier by restoring the cell junctions between endothelial cells that ordinarily regulate molecule transport and leakage. In health, levels of ADM in the bloodstream and extravascular space are in equilibrium so that endothelial barrier integrity is maintained and blood pressure remains normal. 
Loss of vascular integrity in septic shock 
Adrecizumab therapeutic approach 
 
 
In sepsis, more ADM is produced to counteract loss of endothelial barrier function, but as the endothelial barrier becomes more permeable as a result of systemic immune dysregulation, more ADM enters the extravascular space in a dangerous cycle that can contribute to shock and organ failure. 
Administration of the monoclonal antibody Adrecizumab results in an elevation of ADM concentration within the circulation. The ADM-Adrecizumab complex is functional, thus ADM can still act on the endothelium. Consequently, Adrecizumab treatment immediately and precisely promotes ADM’s protective effects on the endothelial barrier. 
For further information on the mode of action of Adrecizumab see title story and editorial in the peer-reviewed journal SHOCK (Shock, 2018). 
 
 
 
Suitability of using Adrecizumab to treat loss of vascular integrity is based on evidence obtained in multiple preclinical intensive care-like vascular integrity models with Adrecizumab applied on top of mimicked human standard of care treatment (e.g. fluids, vasopressors).Adrecizumab treatment significantly improves all clinically relevant endpoints such as reduction of vascular leakage and vasopressor demand, stabilization of the circulation, normalization of fluid balance and kidney function. In preclinical septic shock models, Adrecizumab reduced the mortality by 50% (Intens Care Med Exp, 2013; Intens Care Med, 2013; Shock, 2018).Furthermore, based on analyses of blood samples from well-defined patients, Adrenomedullin was reported as a therapeutic target and biomarker (bio-ADM®) for vascular integrity in several peer-reviewed scientific articles (Crit Care Med,  2020; Crit Care, 2018; Shock, 2018).The recently marketed Adrenomedullin assay (sphingotest® bio-ADM®) allows the identification of patients suffering from loss of vascular integrity and will enable physicians to specifically treat these people by using Adrecizumab. 
clinical development
 
The lead candidate Adrecizumab is ready for a pivotal trial. In the AdrenOSS-2 (proof-of-concept phase II trial in septic shock) Adrecizumab demonstrated a favorable safety profile, was well tolerated and showed improved organ function and survival compared to placebo.The monoclonal antibody Adrecizumab, presented a favorable safety profile in septic shock patients. Thereby meeting the primary trial objective. An improvement of organ function and a subsequent reduction of mortality has been observed.A pre-specified biomarker analysis illustrated that treatment with Adrecizumab after ICU admission resulted in a rapid and sustained improvement of systemic organ function (SOFA score). Subsequently, the relative mortality was reduced by more than 30% after day 28. The positive effect on survival persisted over 90 days.For further information please see the following article. 
The biomarker-guided, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial AdrenOSS-2 investigated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Adrecizumab in 301 patients with early septic shock and elevated blood levels of Adrenomedullin. The multi-centre trial was carried out in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands. In addition to standard of care, patients received Adrecizumab or placebo. The Phase II trial design was published in BMJ Open (BMJ Open, 2019). 
 
 
Results of Phase I trials evaluating Adrecizumab safety and tolerability  
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase Ia and Ib studies included a total of forty-eight healthy volunteers to evaluate escalating doses of Adrecizumab.Adrecizumab demonstrated an excellent safety profile in both studies. Additionally, the Phase Ib study in systemic inflammation indicated dose-dependent beneficial effects of Adrecizumab on vascular integrity without affecting inflammatory parameters. Results of the Phase Ia/b trials were published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2018).

													VASCULAR INTEGRITY												
 
Vascular integrity – fundamental for human health
 
 
Regulation of vascular integrity is a fundamental process for human physiology and pathology. The vascular endothelium is the essential organ for the function of blood vessels in the human body. It is a cell monolayer that forms an essential and selective barrier between the blood vessels and the tissue compartment. The vascular endothelium actively maintains more than 100,000 kilometers of blood vessels. 
Conditions that are most threatening to life, such as sepsis, septic shock, and acute heart failure, are driven by severe impairment of the vascular endothelial barrier presenting in porous, leaky blood vessels and resulting in tissue congestion and edema. Ultimately, the rapid fall in blood pressure and diminished oxygen supply to organs leads to multiple organ failure and death. 
Adrenomedullin (ADM) – key regulator of vascular integrity
 
Since its discovery in 1993, the vasoprotective hormone Adrenomedullin has attracted a great deal of interest as a multifunctional regulator of the vascular system.In the circulation, Adrenomedullin directly tightens the gaps between endothelial cells, subsequently preventing vascular leakage.Adrenomedullin (bio-ADM®) was validated as therapeutic target and biomarker as reported in several scientific publications. Rising bio-ADM® values in patients’ blood samples clearly indicate a worsening of vascular integrity independent from inflammation or any other comorbidity, reflecting the patients need for a targeted therapy addressing this pathophysiology. 
Sepsis & Septic Shock
 
Every year, millions of people around the world are affected by sepsis. In the US, sepsis contributes to between one third and half of deaths of hospitalized people, making it the number one cause of death in hospitals (JAMA, 2014). The annual cost of treating sepsis patients amounts to US$24 billion (Crit Care Med, 2018) in the US alone.Sepsis has been defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (JAMA, 2016). This means that the body’s systemic immune reaction to an infecting pathogen gets out of control and starts affecting tissues and organs. Alongside these inflammatory responses, different regulatory systems such as cardio-vascular, metabolic and coagulation are affected.A central driver of the pathogenesis of sepsis is the increasing loss of endothelial barrier function. In other words: The loss of vascular integrity. This leads to an uncontrolled leakage of fluid, proteins and cells into the surrounding tissue.Patients suffer from a rapid drop in blood pressure (hypotension) and strong abnormalities in circulatory, cellular, and metabolic function. The reduced blood pressure, which further limits oxygen supply to organs (hypoperfusion), contributes to the development of multi-organ failure and death.The current standard of care for septic shock patients is limited to anti-infectives, administration of vasopressors, fluids and supportive care. 
 
With a biomarker-guided approach utilizing Adrenomedullin as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target, Adrecizumab addresses the loss of vascular integrity to reduce vascular leakage, restore hemodynamic stability and consequently improve organ function and reduce mortality. 
COVID-19
 
In COVID-19 and sepsis, a common disease mechanism is the compromised endothelial barrier with an uncontrolled permeability. SARS-CoV-2 replicates in endothelial cells and leads to a breakdown of the endothelium via inflammatory pathways. This subsequently results in vascular leakage and severe impairment of organ function (Nat Rev Immunol, 2020; Nat Rev Immunol, 2021). High adrenomedullin levels indicating loss of vascular integrity are associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients (J Clin Med, 2021).While current therapeutic approaches to treat COVID-19 patients are antivirals or anti-inflammatory therapies, Adrecizumab addresses the endothelial barrier to restore vascular integrity. Treatment with Adrecizumab aims to reduce vascular leakage, improve organ function and reduce mortality. 
 
At the beginning of the pandemic, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in Hamburg, Germany, conducted a case series in critically ill COVID-19 patients with promising results (Biomolecules, 2020). Following this, the UKE is initiating and conducting a multicenter Phase II clinical trial to evaluate Adrecizumab in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05156671). The clinical trial and the manufacturing of Adrecizumab are supported by funds from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).
