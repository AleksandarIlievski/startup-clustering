Connectivity 3:40
How do I connect a database to D-QUANTUM?
  
  
Our vision:
We combine the business and technical view on metadata.
  
3. INTEGRATED DATA MANAGEMENT
  
D-QUANTUM combines AI-supported, business metadata from the Business Glossary with the automatedly connected technical data objects in the Data Catalog. This enables easy access to the technical data world. Responsibilities, data processing procedures and further information can thereby be recorded and visualised for the traceability of the technical realisation of business key figures.
On this basis, you complement Data Contracting, Quality Management and Request Management. In this way, you get the maximum potential from D-QUANTUM and your data landscape.
  
DATA CONTRACTINGDATA QUALITY MANAGEMENTDATA REQUEST MANAGEMENT
  
4. DATA CONTRACTING
  
D-QUANTUMData Contracting is the solution for digitally and centrally documenting agreements made within the framework of a data supply process, e.g. data supply agreements or interface agreements. Benefit from consistent definitions, responsibilities and clear data correlations in theD-QUANTUMData Catalog.
  
5. DATA QUALITIY MANAGEMENT
  
Do you know the quality of your data? WithD-QUANTUMData Quality Management, the entire process of data quality assurance is included – from the recording of relevant requirements to the documentation of measurement results. This is followed by the derivation of potential quality deficiencies with associated DQ measures and their implementation.
  
6. DATA REQUEST MANAGEMENT
  
TheD-QUANTUMData Request Management promotes cooperation between requesters and suppliers with uniformly defined standard processes. Define data requirements and document agreements in the delivery process, such as the time and progress of implementation and the associated responsibilities. With the help of technical metadata and their link to business requirements, the Data Request Management inD-QUANTUMcreates more transparency and minimises time expenditure and ambiguities when creating requirements.
