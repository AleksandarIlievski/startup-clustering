We fight against child labor one card at a time
We are a social enterprise based in Peru and we produce fair trade greeting cards with pictures taken by underprivileged Peruvian teenagers.
The photographers receive 60% of the proceeds and they invest it in their education.
Our mission is to fight against child labor in Peru and promote education as the driving force to social and economic empowerment.
