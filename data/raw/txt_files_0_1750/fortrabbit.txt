Got sick of wrestling with Linux and Apache so tried out @fortrabbit and very glad I did. Perfect solution.

    Forget servers
    focus on PHP, not on PHP hosting
            PHP as a Service
        
            This is not your grandma's hosting. fortrabbit is affordable as shared hosting, powerful as VPS hosting and carefree as managed hosting.
