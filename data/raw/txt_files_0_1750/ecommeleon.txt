Integrations
They say it has never been easier to sell online.
Whoever “they” are, one thing is clear: they haven’t juggled a rapidly growing number of product listings and marketplaces as they scale. You have.
You know all too well that existing solutions are rigid, limited and unable to meet the ever-changing, disjointed requirements across sales channels.
You have wasted time, money and resources organising messy product data, fixing listing errors and trying to align multiple marketplaces.
The whole process is overwhelming and ineffective — and it hurts your bottom line.
With eCommeleon, you can put an end to all that.
                        See How

More Than Just Another eCommerce Software
Originally developed as an agency solution to help online retailers expand into international marketplaces, the eCommeleon technology has been improving since 2007 and has been used to support over 10,000 marketplace project, enabling hundreds of sellers to launch and sell products on virtually every major marketplace.
Take it from us, there’s more to eCommerce than Amazon.
However, we also understand that marketplaces make managing products across platforms more challenging than it should be — and existing listing tools failed to deliver adequate solutions.
This is why we created a solution of our own: eCommeleon.
Our software integrates with all major marketplaces and collates channel-specific requirements from international sales channels to help you sell anywhere, easily.

Learn More
Is the software difficult to navigate?
Since 2007, our team have worked with every major eCommerce software available. eCommeleon is built to fill in the gaps left by these products, specifically with marketplace sellers in mind.As with any new software, there'll be a learning curve, but we promise that this is a lot easier than figuring out how each marketplace works!
What is the implementation time?
If you're already selling on marketplaces, we could have you set up in eCommeleon and launched on a new one within a few hours.
Depending on the state of your existing product data, how you'd like to connect your systems to ours, and what your overall plans are, a typical onboarding will take between 2 days and 4 weeks.
I already use compelling tools. Is eCommeleon a good choice for me?
eCommeleon can be used to complement or replace your existing tool-suite. What we do, we do well, but we don't do everything.
For example, if you already have a PIM or another listing tool, you might not need those functionalities from us, but our marketplace-specific functionalities will help you squeeze more value out of your current system.
You can learn more about our products here, or take a quiz to find out which of our products could suit your needs here.
Which channels can eCommeleon integrate with?
The short answer is "any".  eCommeleon is built specifically to quickly and easily integrate new channels and marketplaces. Although our priority is marketplaces (of which we already offer all major global marketplaces and are constantly adding more), we can quickly build new integrations via our flexible technology. If you need a specific channel (e.g. your website, warehouse management or ERP system, B2B customers, retail databases, an accounting system, or anywhere else), we can often connect these in as little as 2 hours.
How do I connect to eCommeleon?
eCommeleon is extremely flexible. You can connect your existing systems to eCommeleon via all standard methods including API, XML, CSV, file exchange, file upload or any combination of these. Similarly, if you need to get data out of eCommeleon (such as orders), you can collect it via our API, or we can make it available via any of the above methods.
