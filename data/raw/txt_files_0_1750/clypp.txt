Patrick WunschChief of Staff | Nassauische Heimstätte Wohnstadt 
						Clypp helps our employees tremendously to explain and understand our internal processes and software used in the housing sector. Their centralized platform makes it very easy to find all relevant content whenever needed.					
Susana Bolender-CastanedaHead of Corporate Development, Digitization & Innovations | ABG Frankfurt Holding 
						While I am already used to watching video tutorials in my private life, this was not possible in a business context until now, because the effort required to create and maintain video tutorials was too great. With Clypp, this is no longer a problem.
