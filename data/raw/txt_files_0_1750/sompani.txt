                Sompani has been a fantastic partner. Since we started working together 3 years ago,
                they have brought great value to our founders by providing an easy-to-use platform
                to share and connect with talented candidates.
            
                The Sompani solutions have been great resources for our portfolio companies. As a
                fund, we’ve really appreciated Sompani’s willingness and flexibility to implement our
                product requests.
            
                Sompani has enabled our portfolio of +150 companies to leverage its network effects.
                It has become a great value add in multiplying our platform efforts to finding the best
                talents fast.
            
                We were one of the first VCs to use Sompani's Talent Pool which candidates really appreciated
                becoming part of if they weren’t a match for our roles.
