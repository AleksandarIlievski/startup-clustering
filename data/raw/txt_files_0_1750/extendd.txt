Laser projection supports quality assuranceParticularly in quality assurance and the production of high-quality goods, reworking is often done manually. The earlier producers rework, the more efficient the process. Clear indications on the moving component show where the points to be reworked are located and thus facilitate this work step. An automated inspection system systematically records the spots beforehand. The laser system makes them clearly visible to the worker in the finishing area. Dynamic tool tracking also detects whether and how carefully the spots have been reworked. Highest quality results.
Laser Projection With video projection step by step to the perfect resultWERKLICHT Video visualizes individual work steps or detailed cable runs directly on the workpiece. The fitter does not have to search for the right position for a long time but can concentrate fully on the execution. This ensures the highest quality standards despite a high number of variants, thus minimizing time-consuming reworking and reducing costs.
Video Projection Precisely dimension with laser projectionError excluded: The dynamic laser projection accurately locates the correct position for studs or holders or the course of weld seams or trim on the workpiece to within a few tenths of a millimeter. WERKLICHT Pro references itself automatically. Time saving, precise work with high product quality and without long setup times is thus easily possible even for complex components with curved surfaces and different viewing areas.
Laser Projection X-ray vision thanks to dynamic video projection With the help of video projection, the invisible is made visible – directly on the component. The 3D visualization helps to make faster decisions, for example in the design process or during error analysis. Everyone sees immediately what is at stake, and the direct visualization facilitates discussion in the team.
Video Projection The dynamic laser projection is a digital templateDynamic laser projection makes assembly and quality assurance easier, faster, more flexible and more cost-efficient. No more stocking large sets of templates. Variant attachments can be quickly and accurately recorded and working positions marked. Whether the workpiece or the projector is moved – the laser projection maintains the position.
Laser Projection Video and Laser Projection: Augmented Reality for Industry 4.0Industry 4.0 means one thing above all: digitization that makes industrial processes more flexible in order to keep pace with the diversity of variants and optimize manufacturing processes. Dynamically controlled video and laser projectors connect analog steps with the digital world – from the CAD drawing and projection onto the workpiece to the comparison of plan and actual status.
ProductsConnecting digital 3D plan data with reality using WERKLICHT 3D softwareThe functional principle of WERKLICHT allows work points or areas to be precisely marked by laser or video projection, and notes on work steps to be indicated directly on the workpiece. The software uses crosshairs to indicate reference points and employees can place components correctly. The crosshairs thus ensure a consistent level of quality.
Video Projection  
Fields of application and application scenarios of laser and video projection in industryDynamic video and laser projection show their strengths in various industrial areas – especially where manual processes are necessary. Particularly in complex situations, such as short cycle times, a high number of assembly steps or a large number of variants, it can greatly simplify manual work. The areas of application for our video and laser projection range from prototype construction and one-off production to quality assurance during series production, flow production and short-cycle inline processes. Wherever, for example, steel or sheet metal must be processed manually with precision and error-free assembly steps are necessary, dynamic laser and video projection saves time. At the same time, it reduces the effort required because physical positioning and inspection templates can be dispensed with. The time benefits include reduced setup and inspection times and less rework because high-precision work is performed right from the start. In addition, time-consuming searching is eliminated because the position is projected unambiguously onto the component. A particularly important application scenario: the production of many model variants with tight cycle times. In this case, the projection shows the assembler the correct positions for the respective variant – for example, for the assembly of add-on parts. Misinterpretation is hardly possible: This reduces scrap and promotes quality.
 
In pre-assembly and final assemblyWhether individual assemblies or nearly finished products, WERKLICHT identifies assembly positions and specifies the logical assembly sequence.

Laser and video projection for numerous industriesIndustriesJust as CAD systems and digital component information are used in almost every branch of industry, WERKLICHT is also used in a large number of industrial sectors. Because wherever digital 3D data from CAD, measurement/simulation results or surface and texture data are used, WERKLICHT helps to turn them into reality. From unit-dependent automotive manufacturing to shipbuilding with batch size 1, the advantages of WERKLICHT can be used everywhere.
Industries 
Automotive EngineeringSpeed up processes, reduce error rates, optimize quality: These are the three most important advantages of video and laser projection in the automotive industry.
ShipbuildingIn shipbuilding, laser projection helps to realize digital plans. For example, the positions of add-on parts are projected to the exact positions on the ship’s hull using laser projection, or digital templates are projected onto assemblies when welding the hull.
Machinery & Plant EngineeringIn mechanical and plant engineering, laser projection accelerates and simplifies processes from vision to production. The elimination of physical templates makes the production process more cost-effective. Laser projection can also be used in quality assurance to minimize the error rate.
Aircraft ConstructionThe time required for the precise assembly of holders in aircraft construction can be reduced by up to 50 percent thanks to laser projection. This is possible thanks to the clear projection of the exact holder positions and orientation directly onto the fuselage of the aircraft, which is easy for the fitters to understand.
Commercial and Special Vehicle ConstructionA wide variety of model variants produced in small series – this is what characterizes special vehicle construction. Whether agricultural machinery, caravans, sports cars or even prototype construction, laser projection can enable time savings of up to 75% where components have to be fitted or trimmed, add-on parts positioned and assemblies mounted.
Rail Vehicle ConstructionRail vehicles consist of particularly large and complex components. Laser projection replaces positioning templates, supports the positioning and welding of these components, outputs work instructions from CAD data and displays them directly during work processes.
 
Why video and laser projection from EXTEND3D?Solutions from EXTEND3D aim to provide optimal support for production, assembly, quality assurance and rework. The solutions lead to higher productivity thanks to intuitive worker guidance. The system is easy to set up, and quickly ready for use. The integrated OPC-UA interface is part of all products and enables integration into plants and synchronization with conveyor technology. Projection contents are then displayed fully automatically as soon as a component is conveyed into the relevant area. In addition, EXTEND3D offers particular flexibility in laser projection: The components can be moved or repositioned in the work process and the projection system adapts seamlessly to the new conditions thanks to dynamic referencing.
 
Dynamic ReferencingDynamic referencing enables particularly high precision with the greatest possible flexibility at the same time. This means that our video and laser projectors can project the digital template onto the component at any time – regardless of whether the object or the projector is moving. The dynamics of the movement are captured by calibrated cameras and software with smart image processing algorithms and continuously calculated for the projection. This makes it possible for the laser or video image to “lock” onto the workpiece, as it were – even when it is moving. In dynamic referencing, a distinction is made between two methods: marker-based and markerless tracking. Marker-based tracking works flexibly on a wide variety of components and materials and enables high-precision digital templates while complying with specified dimensioning regulations from the construction drawing. Markerless tracking is ideal for short cycle processes.
Calibration for precise projectionFor dynamic referencing to work, the video or laser projection system needs calibration. With our simple and precise solutions, we ensure high and lasting process reliability of the system. There are three calibration methods to choose from: Either the projectors are calibrated and certified in-house in our in-house calibration laboratory or the customer performs recalibration steps himself using a test board. In addition, for integrated systems, there are also automated self-calibration mechanisms in the target environment, which are performed regularly in the process. In general, our Werklicht projection systems are robust and designed for daily use on the factory floor. This is especially true for the systems in mobile use.
Highest precision even for difficult surfacesLaser projection offers maximum precision even on uncooperative surfaces that are particularly dark or highly shiny, for example. Everything you need to know about laser projection can be found on our Wiki page.
Optimal visualization thanks to video projectionOur WERKLICHT VIDEO ensures direct transfer of the data “into practice” – onto the component in question: the engine hood, the ship’s hull or the prototype. Compared to lasers, this projection is absolutely flicker-free and as much content as required can be displayed. In addition, different colors are available for the image. For example, it can display measurement results on the workpiece in the form of false color and deviation maps or individual point measurement values. Everything you need to know about video projection can be found on our Wiki page.
