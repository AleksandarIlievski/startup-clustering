Why TVARIT?
TVARIT is the specialist in AI solutions for foundries and metalworking industries. One of our most important unique selling points is a Hybrid AI approach. We fuse physics equations into our AI models to ensure close to zero errors in our prediction. The second unique selling point is the use of “Transfer Learning” (TL). TL enables our software to use previously acquired knowledge and experience for other problems. This makes TiA highly scalable: we can roll out our solution to many machines in one plant in a very short time. 
And finally, it is our team that makes TVARIT special: Our highly qualified experts come from renowned institutions such as TU Darmstadt, RWTH Aachen, Stanford University or the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
