VAT in the Digital Age - The Next VAT Reform for E-Commerce?
What the EU has planned sounds very promising. VAT returns and paying VAT in EU countries could become simpler and more digitalised. For e-commerce, this could mean that common business models will also be considered in the future. What was intended with the VAT reform for e-commerce in 2021 through the One-Stop-Shop (OSS) could now be achieved: simplification of meeting VAT obligations.  
In this article you can find out what is planned, whether online sellers and their tax advisors can expect relief from VAT obligations for EU e-commerce in the future, and what the EU Commission's timetable looks like. 
                                            go to Article
