Energy efficiency for old and mid-size buildingsStart digitalising, decarbonising and optimising your buildings with perto IOTABook demoContact usWhat we doWe have developed pertoIOTA – a smart and digital Building Management System (BMS) that controls automatically building energy systems like heating, ventilation etc. using AI. It can save up to 50 % of energy consumption & CO2 emissions. The system is affordable, standardised and plug & play, works in every building and therefore the best way to refurbish existing buildings in a scalable way.   + 50buildings+ 180.000squared meters+ 22%energy savingsHow we do itBuildings consume more energy than required due to a lack of management. It avoids saving energy and emissions, but we are here to solve that.Thanks to the Internet of Things, the data gathered from the devices like pumps or temperature sensors is sent to the cloud.pertoIOTA is the brain of the system. It allows the user to explore all the data from their buildings as well as optimise them automatically.pertoIOTA is able to optimize the buildings thanks to features like the scheduler, the automation, and artificial intelligence.The implementation of pertoIOTA will make buildings green and optimized, saving +15% of energy consumption and CO2 emissions.The advantages of the complete perto systemReal time MonitoringContinuously monitors building to ensure the smooth running of all facilities.The real-time monitoring feature of our IoT system allows building managers to constantly track the performance of their heating pumps and temperature sensors.
By utilizing sensors placed throughout the building, the system is able to accurately measure and display the current temperature in each room or zone. More detailsPredictive maintenanceCustom-built formulas & regular assessment help in the early detection of faults in energy systems.The system monitors the status and efficiency of the heating pumps, alerting building managers if any issues arise or if maintenance is needed.
This ensures that the heating system is always operating at optimal levels, improving comfort for occupants and potentially saving energy and costs.Learn moreControllingFacilitates remote controlling of utilities to ensure required operating parameters.The controlling feature of the IoT system installed in the building is the ability to remotely control the devices.
This feature allows the user to adjust the settings and functioning of the devices from any location with an internet connection.More detailsOptimiseThrough Scheduler, Automation, and Artificial Intelligence, pertoIOTA leads to significant energy savings.Using sensors and artificial intelligence, the system can learn the typical usage patterns and energy needs of each space and automatically adjust the system settings to match. By customizing the schedules for each area, the system can significantly reduce energy waste and lower utility costs.
Additionally, the system can be programmed to automatically turn off appliances when not in use, further reducing energy consumption.Learn moreYou are just a few steps away from saving01Book a demo & evaluate savingsOur experts will show you how our product works and help you understand the potential savings for your business.
