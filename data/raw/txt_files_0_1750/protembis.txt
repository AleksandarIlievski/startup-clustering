Clinical Need
Brain injury during leftsided heart procedures is a risk. Silent brain infarcts occur in nearly all transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR). They are associated with cognitive decline, up to 4-fold risk of future stroke, more than 3-fold risk of mortality, and more than 2-fold risk of dementia. Clinical stroke rates as high as 9% have been reported following TAVR.

Protected TAVR
ProtEmbo acts as a guide for other interventional devices. The TAVR procedure can be performed according to standard practice. During the procedure ProtEmbo deflects emboli away from the three head vessels to the brain. The device has 60µm pores and is coated with heparin.
