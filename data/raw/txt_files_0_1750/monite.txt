Someone else earns from your clients’ payments. Take this revenue back.

                    Payment links
                
                    Bill pay
                
                                        Your customer emails an invoice with a payment link attached
                                    
                                        Their client pays it in one click by card, bank transfer, or other popular methods
                                    
                                        Invoices with payment links get paid 40% faster, so your clients don’t need to chase payments.
                                        Monite does this for them
                                    
                                        Your customer gets notified when the invoice is paid, and reconciliation is automated
                                    
                                        You earn up to 0.5% on every invoice payment. Markups for each payment method are adjustable
                                    
                                        A bill is forwarded or uploaded to your platform and prepared for payment
                                    
                                        The user pays the bill with open banking, credit card, or other methods. You make commission on
                                        every payment – e.g. up to 2% on card payments
                                    
                                        The payment is charged to the user’s card or account and sent to the supplier via SEPA/ACH or
                                        another payment method
                                    
                                        If the user paid the bill with a credit card, standard credit terms apply—for instance, allowing up
                                        to 30 extra days to pay the balance

                        to chase payments. Monite does this for them.

                        ACH/SEPA or a preferred payment method

Finance is a pain
Today, SMBs handle finance manually, leading to lost time, money, cash flow
                    and spending control.
                
02
5-7 tools are needed
It’s hard to automate everything. SMBs need to onboard 5-7 specialized tools
                    for finance alone, which is too pricey and complex.
                
03
SMBs want an all-in-one solution
SMBs dream of automated finance management on a platform they use daily.
Onece a software demonstrates its value, customers consolidate around it for all of
                their needs, transforming it into a one-stop shop.
