« HOW DOES THAT WORK? »
Evaluate customer sentiment
Callexa uses modern 1 click surveys based on Net Promoter® Score (NPS), measuring the willingness of your customers to recommend you to their friends or colleagues. By doing so, your customer puts his credibility on the line, which evidentially results in more accurate assessments than impersonal ratings. NPS is already used by many well-known companies and has proven to achieve higher response rates than ordinary survey methods.
Our survey template is optimized for mailings and compatible with most email clients or webmail services. Adapt it to your needs with custom text blocks, personalized salutation and your company logo. No tedious scripting, what you see is what you get.
Net Promoter, Net Promoter Score, and NPS are trademarks of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc., and Fred Reichheld.
Manage your survey recipients
					Conduct directed customer surveys regulary or by using our API right after certain events.
					For example several days after an order, a support inquiry or even a cancellation.
					
4 ways to connect to your customers:
Link to the survey in your newsletters or on your website.
Manage recipient lists to target a selected group of customers.
Import and export data easily with CSV files.
Use our API to connect Callexa to your CRM or Online Shop.
					We provide a distributed mailing service or you can set up your own mail server to send scheduled surveys with just a few clicks.
				
Monitor your company scoring
					Track the development of your overall scoring, based on the responses you get. Our well-arranged dashboard keeps you informed
					about the feedback coming in and our detailed reports help you to evaluate your service.
					
					Get realtime feedback on the impact of changes you made	in your customer service. Get to know the reasons for cancellations or
					returning goods. React to critism immediately and know your strengths and weaknesses.
					
					Callexa is a brand new service. We want you to be open to suggestions, so we are too.
					Try our service for free and if there is anything you need, just tell us!

« Testimonials »
                                    I am absolutely thrilled about Callexa. Design, usability, configuration options, cockpit - everything very intuitive & structured. I have worked with Zenloop so far and I think Callexa is even better already! Especially for start-ups, it's a great tool to develop the product or service for the future in cooperation with the customer.
                    - Stephan Berg, Founder & CEO So schmeckt Erfolg
                                    We already knew the Net Promoter Score from previous customer surveys. To ensure and evaluate the quality of "infra-structure", we were planning to carry out a customer satisfaction survey, which is simple and which would also be done quickly.
                    The detailed feedback from customers regarding our software "infra-structure" could be passed on to our development department in the form of suggestions for improvement; also as problem cases to the support department for further treatment.
                    - Ino Holling, CEO NETZkultur
                                    We launched on BigCommerce in early 2019 and immediately added Callexa as our NPS tool. Once integrated and dialed in (super easy!), we're automatically surveying customers to get a glimpse into what we're doing well and what we should work to improve. The feedback has been invaluable as we prioritize improvements and additional optimizations to the site and our fulfillment processes. There are more expensive, complex, and customizable NPS tools out there, but Callexa continues to provide the insight we need in an easy to use and cost effective format. I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a NPS solution for their BigCommerce storefront.
                                - Philip Krug, Marketing West Coast Sailing
                                    We have used the Quotes of our very satisfied customers in our user reports.
                                - Stefanie Heither-Bürger, Marketing NETZkultur
                                    Very sleek and good tool, we have only had the best experiences.
                    - Dr. Michael Streng, Managing Partner parameta
                                    The Net Promoter Score is a central element in connection with customer feedback. Simple, neat, professional!
                    With Callexa Feedback you are offering an outstanding NPS tool for a quick and uncomplicated customer response, suitable for daily use.
                    - Dr. Lars Wohlers, CEO KON-TIKI
