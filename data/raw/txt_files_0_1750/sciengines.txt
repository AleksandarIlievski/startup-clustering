FPGA Computing 
not just ordinary supercomputers 
SciEngines is a young innovation-driven company located in Kiel, Germany. The company was established in 2007 with the vision of improving the efficiency of High-Performance Computing (HPC) by orders of magnitude. The mission to make supercomputing-performance levels accessible to a broad user-group is achieved by developing application-specific computing systems based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which also retain flexibility to address changing user-requirements and future developments.
