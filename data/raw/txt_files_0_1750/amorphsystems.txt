WHAT OUR HAPPY CLIENTS SAY
“Now, during the Corona COVID-19 outbreak, we needed to extract live passenger data in combination with predicted values. Together with Amorph Systems we acted quickly and had this feature ready in only a few days for all relevant parties at Helsinki airport to support daily operations for handling the current situation.”Matti Lehto, Helsinki Airport
“Amorph.pro helped us in seamlessly tracking our products and monitor the equipment parameters of our production line resulting in a significant improvement of the throughput rate and the on time delivery performance.”Norbert Plogmann, Managing Director, United Monolithic Semiconductors GmbH, Ulm
“This is a mission critical system that plays a vital role for the daily operational activities at Frankfurt Airport. A large number of users from various departments are relying on it for controlling their daily terminal operations. During the 2013 Summer season, with the highest passenger counts in Frankfurt Airport’s history, the peak days would not have been manageable without the continuously updating passenger flow online forecasts for all the process points.”Daniel Zimbrich, Frankfurt Airport Terminal Operations
“Amorph Systems is a longtime partner of ZF, supporting us in creating advanced vertical and horizontal IT architectures for our future Industrie 4.0 IT landscapes. Amorph Systems provides excellent expertise in the production IT domain and contributes strongly to ZF’s global Industry 4.0 targets with their deep experience in advanced IT and automation.”Patrick Warken, Production Execution (FIOP), FC Production Execution, ZF Friedrichshafen AG
“The implementation of AMORPH.aero has been a very ambitious journey with the purpose of building us a capability to see into the near and more distant future, and utilize this capability for better capacity planning, resource allocation, terminal operation and more relevant passenger communication. To fulfill these expectations across multiple dimensions would not have been possible without the committed and highly talented Amorph team, with whom we had the privilege to work with. Now, we have a strong solution running, with a truly inspiring roadmap that will hopefully take the Helsinki Airport experience to new and unseen heights.”Eero Knuutila, Head of Service Development, Finavia Corp., Helsinki
“Amorph’s SMARTUNIFIER platform was chosen by AZUR SPACE because of its unique capabilities to easily and rapidly provide seamless interconnectivity to the various shop floor equipment installed within AZUR SPACE’s production plant. The possibility to start small by beginning with the integration of only a small number of equipment (or even one single equipment) and then step by step to scale up to 100% equipment integration rate, has been seen as a unique advantage of SMARTUNIFIER platform.”Jürgen Heizmann, CEO, AZUR SPACE Solar Power GmbH, Germany
“AMORPH.aero Planning Studio has proven to be a very capable and versatile simulation tool. The Amorph team keeps on developing its functionality based on our customer feedback.”Florian Raff, Head Planning & Development Ground Operation, Zürich Airport
“Connectivity is an important basis for industrial digitalization. Our customers are going to benefit from this partnership by receiving innovative, data driven digital manufacturing solutions with highly individual data integration on the basis of Amorph’s standardized gateway tool.”Ingo Müller, Lead Innovation Manager SCM, T-Systems
