“When I’m at the water with my family, we all wear Restube. It’s so small that you don’t even notice. Restube makes us all feel good and the best part is that the kids love it.”
Lea WeberMother
“I have been an enthusiastic kite surfer for years. As a professional athlete, I especially want to feel free when I’m out on the sea alone. Restube gives me my “peace of mind”.”
Emmanuel NormanProfessional kite surfer
"Restube is simply brilliant for lifeguards. It’s so small that I can always carry it with me. If I have to rescue someone, I can jump straight into the water, have my hands free and have enough buoyancy to secure the person."
Clemens KopplinChief of fire at the fire station Putbus on Rügen
“We always use our restube when fishing. We love our passion and fishing in harsh conditions, but at the same time we don’t want to risk our lives. Safety has priority, so we carry Restube with us!”
Reality Fishing Crew
“As the organizer of the Red Bull Battle of the Sund in Sweden, we decided to make every participant even more secure by wearing Restube.”
