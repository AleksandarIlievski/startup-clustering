With this revolutionary technology, an measurement of the electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) can be proceeded without contacting the skin, even through layers of different materials.
​
Compared to other non-contact measuring technologies, the capacitive ECG measurement is superior and provides more detailed and reliable information. Depending on the applications and requirements, the measurement of the heart rate in the highest medical standard is possible as well as measurements of the heart rate variability, the respiratory rate and additional derivable parameters. Cardiac arrhythmias can be reliably recognized as well.
​
Due to long-time research, clinical trials, and extensive application experience, we can now provide you the advantages of this technology for commercial products. Feel free to contact us and convince yourself of the superiority of our solutions.TechnologieCardiac monitoring can’t be easierThe integration of flexible capacitive ECG electrodes in your product enables you to receive information about the heart activity and derived physical parameters without any additional effort. The main advantages for our customers are:
Highest AccuracyWe record the heartrate in highest accuracy via an ECG. From this signal, you receive additional information about physical parameters like heart rate variability or respiratory rate.
Highest ComfortOur solutions are neither visible nor perceptible and therefore meet the highest comfort requirements of your product.
IndividualizationWe use different material compositions and production technologies to be able to provide you sensors of any size and shape.Product DevelopmentDevelopment ServiceCapital’s long-time experience in different sectors makes turns us into a dependable development partner for the integration of capacitive sensors.
