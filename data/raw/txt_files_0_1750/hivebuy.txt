Trust meets satisfaction
„The process now runs ideally: We specify a process chain that includes all release steps. At the end, the purchase order matches the corresponding invoice. It enables us to manage liquidity and saves time for everyone involved because invoices are no longer released separately. It also means increased supplier satisfaction because you get paid faster and there are no overdues.
“
„We went live with Hivebuy in just one day -
Due to our rapid growth, it was important for us to find a tool that can accompany this growth quickly and easily and help us to digitalize our procurement! This is exactly what we have achieved with Hivebuy.“
Founder Sanity Group
„Super simple and easy set-up - the best thing that could have happened to us in purchasing. Set up eProcurement smartly and intuitively: Roles, departments and budget were defined and set up in just a few minutes.“
Nick Stodt, VP Finance Hypatos

For what reasons do you not yet use purchasing software?
The acquisition is associated with too high costs and time
Worried that the investment won't pay off because setup fees, implementation efforts, and training bundle too many resources?
Our promise to you:
We don't charge a setup fee, you only pay per user.
Hivebuy is implemented so quickly that hardly any resources are needed. The procurement software is ready for use throughout the company within 1 hour.
Training of employees is redundant due to the intuitive usability of the software. 
Uncertainty and fear of contact with new technologies
Are you unsure how employees will receive new software and whether they will use it at all?
Concerns about data protection in e-procurement
How secure is my exchanged data and information in a cloud?
You can be sure that your data is in the best hands with us. We attach great importance to data protection. Our data center is located in Germany and your data never leaves the European area.
Furthermore, end-to-end encryption provides additional security. Particularly sensitive data, such as invoices, is stored in extra-protected entities. Daily backups and redundant systems protect you from data loss.
