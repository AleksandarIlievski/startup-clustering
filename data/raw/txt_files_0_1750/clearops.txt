ClearOps connects OEMs, Dealers, and Machines to transform aftermarket service!
ClearOps is a new type of SaaS technology!
ClearOps easily connects the downstream supply chain – acting as a data integration hub while also automating and optimizing the after-sales service operation. The combination of over 25 years of Supply Chain Expertise from Barkawi Management Consultants combined with the technical expertise of the ClearOps group – ClearOps enables the fastest time to value in the market measured in weeks and months instead of months and years.
ClearOps Service Cloud Solutions – Why?
True optimization of the service operation hinges on the ability to connect your supply chain network. ClearOps solves this challenge connecting OEM(s), Dealers, and Machines. Our agnostic data integration technology enables our clients to seamlessly connect dealer inventory, as well as many other service and machine systems and applications through our pre-built interfaces. It also lays the foundation for our Advanced Inventory Management Engine, Service and Tech Management Solution, a sophisticated IoT pillar and other offerings such as a fully integrated end-to-end E-commerce system. Today’s new service economy makes it more important than ever to be close to your customer. ClearOps bridges the gap enabling visibility and communication across the supply chain network- making proactive and best-in-class customer service achievable!
Achieving proactive and best-in-class customer service is your goal.
We provide the network connectivity and optimization tools to help you achieve it!

Many customers feel left alone with the daunting task of connecting their service network and integrating the many systems in use. It’s no “walk in the park” in large dealer ecosystems with hundreds, or even thousands of dealers. We do it better!
Our platform has established interfaces to hundreds of common dealer ecosystem applications. We don’t have to go through tiresome development phases to connect to your systems. We simply connect and activate the players across the service network.
Not only do we serve as a data integration hub, the ClearOps support team ensures the flow of data and data compatibility until all transactions are correct- right down to the decimal point. Together, this means a pilot can be accomplished in just a few weeks, and an entire dealer management network can be connected in no time! Goodbye flying blind!
We manage this 24/7, 365 in our hosted environment – complete with any required testing environments.
Built on the extensive knowledge gained over 25 years of supply chain and aftermarket consulting engagements, our sophisticated forecasting engine ensures minimization of manual processes and revolutionizes the whole inventory management process by driving toward automatic optimization, exception handling, the ability to leveraging simulations and more. ClearOps enables best-in-class customer service at the lowest cost and quickest time to value!
