Tim Kiener
“Developing your own products is very motivating. If then they’re successful as well, you are proud of the whole team.
We have flat hierarchies at wonderkind, but clear areas of responsibility in which every team member assumes a very great deal of personal accountability. We work in a very product and goal-oriented way while also enjoying an atmosphere characterised by mutual respect and affection.”

“As a father of two children, I get a lot of fun out of designing apps for children, working creatively in the process while at the same time having my finger on the pulse of the latest technology. We are constantly in close communication with people and companies from the children’s app industry and enjoy breaking new ground in the development process of a new app. The culmination of our work is products that are of high quality both visually and with regards to their content.”

About us
We make apps for kids
We want our apps to be beautiful and of high quality. So that we we can let our own children loose on them with a clear conscience. We want children to enjoy making discoveries, forever finding out new things and perhaps, or certainly, learning something in the process.
That is why we lavish time on the design. We reflect, refine things and are never quite finished with all the details. Even if we are already working on implementation and programming – additional new ideas are being incorporated all the time. Things are discarded, new things included. We test and put things out to test. By our children. And their friends. And we observe what goes on. What is important to us is how much interest and enthusiasm the children exhibit when using the app. And some things we then often rework and take other things to the next level.

When it comes to learning, we talk to the experts. And we ask friends who are professionally involved with language, education and passing on knowledge. Everyone joins in enthusiastically because the subject interests them and because they are enthusiastic about the infinite possibilities of modern mobile technology.
We love detailed, handcrafted graphics. That’s why a lot of illustration on real paper goes on. With brush, paint and water. With tints and music. Specially composed. Once we are happy with the result, the whole thing is made available for you and your children. For example, via the Apple App Store, Google Play or Windows Store. And if then an old school friend relates how his twins are having so much fun playing with a “fantastic hidden object app”, we smile quietly to ourselves and have achieved our goal.
About wonderkind
wonderkind GmbH was founded in December 2010 by Tim Kiener and Christian Schwendy. From the very first day, wonderkind has concerned itself closely with developing high quality apps for children. Great importance is attached here to child-oriented implementation and presenting the app content in an appealing way.
wonderkind’s distinctive style is characterised by lovingly illustrated watercolours that bring the charm of printed children’s books to modern smart phones and tablets.
