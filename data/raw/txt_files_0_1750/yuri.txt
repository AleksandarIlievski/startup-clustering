Life ScienceOver 2000 experiments on the ISS have proven the beneficial effects of microgravity on biological systems. Sounds like science fiction to you? Convince yourself and learn more about benefits for life sciences in microgravity..1Growing cell cultures in 3DContrary to our planet, where cells are restricted in their development, they can form complex 3D structures in microgravity..2Modeling human diseasesOngoing exposure to microgravity initiates immune dysfunction, bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning and loss of skeletal muscle..3Analyzing proteins and moleculesCrystallization is a crucial method for studying the structures of biomolecules and in microgravity crystals grow larger and in higher quality..4Advancing synthetic biologyThe harsh environment of space creates stress in organisms that can lead to surprising results in artificial evolution..5Studying plant biologyPlants have the ability to “feel” gravity to know in which direction to grow. In space, this reference point is not present, which has considerable effects on plant growth and development..6Advancing nanofluidicsMicrogravity strongly influences fluid dynamics and helps us to better understand the complexity of biomedical devices involving fluids.

improve drug development and cell-based
therapies. I’m excited to support Yuri on
their ambitious journey of creating a new
generation of biotech products in space.”
Matthias MaurerAstronaut“It’s great that Yuri brings the enormous benefits of microgravity to new industries and use-cases.”
M. Araceli Espinosa, Ph.D.Research neurochemist at UCLA“Having worked with the team on our brain cell mission, I strongly recommend them for training and flight integration. They’re a great company open for innovation according to customer needs.”
