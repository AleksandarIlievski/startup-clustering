The Videmo Technology
For more than 10 years, we have been actively developing and improving state-of-the-art video analysis technology in the field of face recognition. Application users will find this in our easy but versatile all-in-one solution Videmo 360, while manufacturers and integrators profit from our open API and the Videmo SDK.
Face Recognition
Our face recognition tools find even the smallest faces in photos or videos of poor quality. By comparing with reference images, known persons are reliably recognized, and their age and gender estimated as well. Thanks to hardware acceleration, all components are suitable for live use.
Deep Learning
Deep neural networks are state of the art tools in image analysis and are the technological foundation of our recognition methods. We design and train our deep nets with large amounts of data in order to achieve the optimal combination of recognition performance and speed.
