With snapADDY DataQuality, we need only 6 hours instead of 11 to enter and update 200 contacts! Thanks to the integrated duplicate check, it is also no longer necessary to manually check for duplicates in the CRM. With the trade fair lead app snapADDY VisitReport, we could also achieve an extreme improvement in processing times after events.
The direct export of the captured data into our Salesforce CRM is very handy and even the recognition of Asian contact data is very good! With snapADDY DataQuality, not only the data quality in the CRM increases but also the use of the CRM system.
Using snapADDY VisitReport has greatly improved the data and meeting content quality we record. Furthermore, the software is optimally adapted to our corporate structures. Follow-up processes have also become much more efficient. We no longer need to deploy additional trade fair staff, which saves us money!
With the implementation of snapADDY DataQuality, we could increase the data quality in the Salesforce CRM system. It is excellent that snapADDY DataQuality is integrated directly into the CRM for capturing and correcting contact data. This makes it extremely flexible and highly efficient.
With snapADDY VisitReport, customers and prospects can sign directly in the app. This works great! Even our legal department is highly satisfied because when the signature is transferred to the CRM, even the timestamp is included.
