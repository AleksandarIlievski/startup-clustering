Maximilian Steiert

After the evaluation by the project management team of the Fraunhofer EU-Network and the Fraunhofer SIT (Institute for Secure Information technology) EMDESK clearly convinced us because of its usability. It also fulfills the strict data-protection standards of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.

EMDESK takes innovative technology and synthesises it with legal and traditional financial management requirements to offer a state of the art management solution system that enables teams to manage scheduling of activities, and allocation of resources mapped to forecast budgets and actual spends. I highly recommend a free trial of EMDESK to see exactly what excellent value for money you will be getting with this platform. My experience of the platform surpassed my expectations. 
Eric Matrou

We thoroughly enjoy working with EMDESK. As a large project with thousands of team members, hundreds of partners and lots of deadlines, we have a tight schedule and special requirements. We would recommend EMDESK to anyone looking for a comprehensive collaboration solution.
José Luis Vadillo López
Fundación CIRCE, Spain
EMDESK provides useful solutions and helps us a lot with project management! At CIRCE we were looking for a good tool to manage our projects. We started using EMDESK with one project and quickly also switched running all projects over to the tool as it gives us accuracy and an integral control over the projects. In addition we are very happy with the technical and commercial support we receive. We strongly recommend the tool!
Paolo Di Michele
Project Manager at SELEX ES SpA, Italy
The use of EMDESK has made the task of managing much more rewarding. You can have full control over every aspect of the program with minimal daily effort. It's really an invaluable tool for managing multiple projects, especially large ones.
Emilija Stoilova

We have an excellent experience with EMDESK. All projects, regardless of their size, small teams or large consortia with 143 partners as in the HBP project, will certainly benefit from it. EMDESK has proven to be a reliable and stable tool indispensable for the management of various project-related processes.

EMDESK is an excellent tool that the team members and partners are able to use easily and quickly. We are happy with the choice we made. I greatly appreciate the fact that project managers at every level are able to report and update directly in EMDESK and I don't have to exchange back and forth with Word.
Prof. Jacqueline O'Reilly
University of Brighton, the UK
We have been really impressed with the software in helping make monitoring and reporting so much easier. The support services in setting up the system and answering questions were always excellent, concise and efficient. I recommend this software to anyone who is planning a project proposal or managing projects as it takes away a lot of the pain of pea counting and formatting proposal and reporting documentation.
Dr Alison Taysum

EMDESK fully integrates all aspects of a large and complex project offering users full and transparent accountability and assurance the system can provide information required for full audits.
Luis Coelho

The organization and sharing of documents, the scheduling of events, the help in the preparation of reports and other features makes EMDESK a strong support for the development of a project of this dimension and responsibility. In line with my experience, I suggest using EMDESK to everyone who will coordinate projects.
Gabriele Hamm

It is a great pleasure to work with EMDESK. The software is a very convincing and facilitating project management tool.
Peggy Favier
Project Manager at L-up
We had heard many things about the power and versatility of EMDESK, so it was an easy choice to use them as a project management tool. This switch increased our ability to handle larger projects and coordinate information among team members. We were also able to cut the time spent on our procedures by 15 percent. EMDESK is one tool that we would definitely recommend to every project manager.

The main results and improvements we achieved, by using EMDESK project management tool, is a greatly reduced workload that enabled gathering inputs by e-mail and collating documents for reporting and monitoring of resources.
Katarina Boustedt

Professionally organized, the EMDESK Team executed the migration from the standard edition to our servers in less than two weeks and provided us with a seamless and uncomplicated service; including consultation with our local server team. EMDESK is a highly reliable partner that provides us with a tool that helps us to manage and monitor all our project activities. Combining a personal service with flexibility and solution-oriented thinking, we recently extended our contract with EMDESK for the next project phase.
Dr. Christian Fauteux
Chief Administrative Officer, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
We selected EMDESK to plan our project proposal after facing problems with other tools. We switched to EMDESK less than 3 months before submission and were very happy that the collaboration went so smoothly. EMDESK met our individual requirements quickly and professionally. With budget and administrative data to be consolidated for more than 80 partners, this was quite an achievement. I believe that such a big project could not have been prepared without its help. Today we use EMDESK as our project management tool.
Eduardo Herrmann
Project Manager at Steinbeis-Europa-Zentrum, Germany
EMDESK is very useful and facilitates the management of research projects. The software differentiates itself from others with its user-friendly interface and the wide range of functions. Most of all, the team actively listens and implements recommendations from its users. EMDESK offers a good value for the money spent. We are extending the use of EMDESK as it integrates well into our workflow and helps to manage projects efficiently.
