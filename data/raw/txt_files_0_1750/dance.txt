As a member, you receive your own electric bike or moped, and access to our round-the-clock maintenance team, who repair and maintain your vehicle. 
Unlike traditional ownership or shared services, Dance gives you the advantages of having your own ride, with the flexibility of a membership.How do I charge my Dance vehicle?Our ebikes and mopeds have a removable battery and charger. You can easily plug the charger into any standard power outlet, so you can conveniently charge your ride at home, in the office, or anywhere else. The charging time of the battery is about 3 hours for ebikes and 6-8 hours for mopeds.
Please note that ebikes and mopeds cannot be charged at charging stations for electric cars.What accessories can I use with my Dance vehicle?You have the option to add various accessories to your Dance ebike or moped. You get a smartphone holder free of charge with our ebikes. You can also add a rear bike basket or a Thule rear-mounted child seat. 
For the mopeds, the following accessories are available for an additional charge: a helmet, a long-distance battery (with a range of up to 70 km), and a top case for additional storage space. We don’t recommend adding additional accessories to your bike or moped. Any damage caused by non-Dance accessories could incur fees.
If you don’t want to rent a child seat from us, please use a Dance approved model. Bear in mind that the fitting of store-bought child seats and accessories is not covered by our Dance concierge service. We've already tested some models for compatibility and safety and will continuously check and update the list of approved child seats.
The following child seats for the rear frame are compatible with the Dance ebikes: 
Thule RideAlongThule RideAlong LiteThule Yepp Nexxt Maxi (frame mount)
Please note: No child seats are allowed on the front or on the rear rack.
We also don't recommend attaching trailers to the Dance ebike. 
We’re working on offering you more accessories for our vehicles and will keep you updated as new ones are available or approved.How do repairs work?You can easily order repairs via the Dance app. After ordering a repair, you can lock your ebike or moped in in a safe and publicly accessible place. 
Our maintenance team locates your bike or moped and takes care of the repair within 24 hours on weekdays. On weekends or holidays, it can take up to 48 hours. Once you have ordered a repair, you won’t be able to use your bike or moped until the repair is completed, but you do not have to be present during this time. 
Please note: you may be charged if our team is unable to access your bike, so be sure to lock and leave it in an accessible place.Can I test the vehicle before subscribing?At the moment we do not offer test rides or trial periods. However, you can just sign up for Dance membership and try out your new ebike or moped directly upon delivery. If you decide you don’t want it, we’ll take it back and you won’t pay any fees.How do I cancel my membership?We’d be sad to see you leave, but if you need to cancel your membership you can do so easily through the Dance app. 
To cancel your membership, click "Settings" in the Dance app and select "Cancel subscription". You’ll receive further instructions via the app and we’ll pick up your ebike or moped. And if you change your mind, we’d be happy to welcome you back to Dance! What happens if my ebike or moped gets stolen?If your vehicle has been stolen, please contact our concierge team as soon as possible via the Dance app and report it. Tell us where you left it and when you last saw or used it. We’ll then immediately investigate and keep you informed about the next steps.Meet our happy membersThe Dance communityIt's super efficient, no sweat, very stable and I get everywhere faster.Luna, Berlin My Dance bike just makes my commute light and fun.James, Berlin I don’t have to worry anymore about my old bike breaking down.Travis, Hamburg Stay up to speedSign up to get the latest Dance offers, updates, and tips straight to your inbox.your@email.deBy checking this box, you allow Dance to collect data relating to the Dance newsletter, including whether it has been opened and clicked through.
