More relief.Our mis­sion is to empow­er health and fit­ness pro­fes­sion­als to unlock their eco­nom­ic and pro­fes­sion­al poten­tial through the best tech­nol­o­gy for dig­i­tal motion analysis.This is where our dig­i­tal and ful­ly con­nect­ed sports and ther­a­py solu­tion comes in. A vir­tu­al per­son­al train­er or vir­tu­al ther­a­pist, as well as a real-time cor­rec­tion on the screen, make train­ing at the Pix­for­mance Sta­tion par­tic­u­lar­ly safe and effec­tive. Train­ing with our dig­i­tal fit­ness device offers many advan­tages, both for you, your com­pa­ny and your employ­ees as well as for the user himself.Learn moreExer­cis­ers /​ YearWork­outs /​ YearFunc­tion­al ExercisesSat­is­fied customers» The patients are enthu­si­as­tic and very moti­vat­ed, which admit­ted­ly is not often the case. Of course, we as ther­a­pists also ben­e­fit from this, as the patients per­form their exer­cis­es bet­ter and more pur­pose­ful­ly. In addi­tion, we save time because, after only 30 min­utes of instruc­tion, the patients can train inde­pen­dent­ly under supervision. «Gabriele Buch­stein, Head Phys­io­ther­a­pistSauer­land­klinik Hachen, Germany» In search of a way to let patients become active on their own, we decid­ed on Pix­for­mance. The indi­vid­ual train­ing offer is ide­al here, as group ther­a­py, for exam­ple, is oth­er­wise too easy for some and too dif­fi­cult for oth­ers. So every­one gets an entire­ly indi­vid­ual workout. «Christoph Schnei­der, Ther­a­py Man­ag­erNieder­rhein Klinik | Rehab Clin­ic Korschen­broich, Germany» I want to estab­lish a sec­ond self-pay area with Pix­for­mance and thus, above all, accom­mo­date my employ­ees and offer them more acces­si­ble and more var­ied work. «Heike Schaible, Own­erPhys­io­ther­a­py Prac­tice “Raum für Gesund­heit”, Germany» The great thing is that I can design the new train­ing com­plete­ly indi­vid­u­al­ly for each of our patients. From com­pet­i­tive ath­letes to grannies, there’s some­thing for every­one. And if a ther­a­pist is ever out, it’s easy to offer that as a back­up and com­pen­sate with Pix­for­mance, so we don’t have to can­cel the ther­a­py session. «Axel-André Richter, Own­erHealth Prac­tice Richter & Lopez, Germany» From the patient side, there is a great deal of inter­est and curios­i­ty about the Pix­for­mance sta­tions. Many even come of their own accord and want a train­ing pro­gram. We recent­ly pro­vid­ed tele-sup­port­ed sup­port for a young lady after shoul­der surgery using the Pix­for­mance app. She then comes to the clin­ic once a week and does the rest of the ther­a­py at home. «Christoph Oratsch, Head of Ther­a­pyAUVA Hos­pi­tal, Kla­gen­furt, Austria» We want­ed a holis­tic train­ing device cov­er­ing as many mus­cle groups and move­ment pat­terns as pos­si­ble in sports ther­a­py. Above all, the flex­i­bil­i­ty you get with the dig­i­tal train­ing con­cept was a cru­cial point for us. «Swet­lana Zim­mer­mann & Claas Bicke­böller, Phys­io­ther­a­pist & Own­erSchloss­physio Win­terthur, Switzerland» We are pleased to see that our patients are delight­ed and per­sis­tent in their exer­cise train­ing. The active com­po­nent of our dig­i­tal Pix­for­mance ther­a­py equip­ment cer­tain­ly plays a part in this. «Gunter Hölig, Ther­a­py Man­ag­erMed­ical Park Bad Rodach, Germany» My mem­bers can be indi­vid­u­al­ly guid­ed and moti­vat­ed for train­ing with Pix­for­mance. I espe­cial­ly like that the han­dling is effort­less, and the sta­tion takes up lit­tle space! «Erwin Kuglmeier, Own­erFit­ness Club Cal­i­for­nia, Germany» We made a con­scious deci­sion to go with Pix­for­mance because we rec­og­nized the oppor­tu­ni­ty, and we’re con­fi­dent that our invest­ment would pay off quickly. «Kim Essink, Own­erFit­ness Club Essink in Eind­hoven, Netherlands» Tar­get­ed health train­ing with the vir­tu­al train­er increas­es the effi­cien­cy of the treat­ment and cre­ates more time for the actu­al care of my patients. «Volk­er Sutor, Own­erPhys­io­ther­a­py Cen­ters “Reha Ron­dell”, Germany  Oxford Brookes University  Forte  Raum für Gesundheit  Sauer­land­klinik  Mrs.Sporty  Charite  Essink Sports­cen­trum  Gesund­heit­sron­dell  Fem­m­e­Fit  Med­ical Park  Gesund­heit in Bewegung  Ther­a­piezen­trum Rombach dig­i­tal fit­ness devices with real-time correctiondig­i­tal fit­ness devices with real-time correction✓ The Inte­grat­ed 2D Full-HD cam­erarecords 25 joint points✓ Vir­tu­al per­son­al train­er showsthe exer­cis­es on-screen✓ Tex­tu­al and visu­al feed­backis shown on-screen✓ The patent­ed sta­tion pro­videsper­son­al­ized feed­back dur­ingand after exercisesINDIVIDUAL SOLUTIONSAs a pio­neer in design­ing dig­i­tal busi­ness trans­for­ma­tions in the fit­ness and health indus­try, we offer you indi­vid­ual solu­tions with our dig­i­tal fit­ness devices to make your busi­ness more effi­cient and successful.PHYSIOTHERAPYCLINICFITNESSCORPORATEINDIVIDUALSOLUTIONSAs a pio­neer in design­ing dig­i­tal busi­ness trans­for­ma­tions in the fit­ness and health indus­try, we offer you indi­vid­ual solu­tions with our dig­i­tal fit­ness devices to make your busi­ness more effi­cient and successful.PHYSIOTHERAPYCLINICFITNESSCORPORATECon­tactPix­for­mance Sports GmbHHelmholtzs­traße 2 – 9GSG Hof /​ Auf­gang H10587 Berlin+49 (0)30 39 80 56 10contact@pixformance.comImprint  |  Pri­va­cy PolicyRecent Blog­postsIncrease Phys­i­cal Ther­a­py Sales: What Oppor­tu­ni­ties Does The Self-Pay Sec­tor Have To Offer Now?Dig­i­ti­za­tion: An Oppor­tu­ni­ty For The Health­care IndustryThree Lessons Fit­ness Clubs Can Learn From Weight Watch­ers’ New Busi­ness StrategyWhy The “Quan­ti­fied Self” Move­ment Is A Busi­ness OpportunityThree Strate­gies On Inte­grat­ing New Tech­nolo­gies Into Your Func­tion­al Fit­ness ClubFol­low us on        © 2023 Pixformance Sports GmbH  MI am hap­py to advise youMr. Tobi­as Baa­der+49 173 626 698 1Get In Touch
