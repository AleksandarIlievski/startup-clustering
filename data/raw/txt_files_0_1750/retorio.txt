What is Behavioral Intelligence?
Behavioral intelligence is the ability to influence a person’s surrounding environment through behavior. It is a powerful tool when it comes to understanding employees and potential candidates on a deeper level and allows you to learn more about the individual needs and skills of your employees which will help you to respond in a way that will drive action and engagement across a wide range of topics.
The science behind Retorio
Retorio is a spin-off of Technical University of Munich, Germany. Retorio’s analysis is based on the universally accepted, advanced psychological model of personality traits, the Big 5 model. This model describes an individual’s personality in terms of 5 dimensions: (1) openness, (2) extraversion, (3) conscientiousness, (4) agreeableness, and (5) neuroticism. In a workplace context observer ratings have an incremental predictive validity over self-reporting. Accordingly, Retorio's AI is trained to analyze the Big 5 according to visible behavior rather than self-estimations. In other words, Retorio does not measure how persons think they are, it measures how they come across in terms of their personality.
