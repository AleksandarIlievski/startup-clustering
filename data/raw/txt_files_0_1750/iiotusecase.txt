"The right offer at the right time. Education and, above all, collaboration are needed in times of digitalization. Transformation is shaped by people - and Madeleine's team definitely knows how to do that best for SMEs."					
THOMAS WEISSHAUPTmanaging director 
"Hats off! I find your generalist approach of looking at the added value of new networking technologies holistically and embedded in context very exciting! Especially because you create a bridge between the various interest groups in German industry."					
CHRISTOPH MANKSenior Product Manager 
"A great channel and very professional. The podcasts not only have a very high technical standard, but are also in a very contemporary format and a decidedly appealing format."					
THORSTEN STOFFELProduct Manager 
"I deal from the financing side about the emerging "banking" needs in the I4.0 context. In doing so, the use cases in your podcast are great inspiration. In particular, the business models"
