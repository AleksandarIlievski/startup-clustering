Picavi smart glasses: intelligent wearable technology
Picavi smart glasses are the piece of innovative wearable tech for your intralogistics operations. They are the personal picking assistant for your staff, enabling precise, zero-fatigue order picking while keeping both hands free. Quick to learn and easy to use, your team will soon come to love working with them.
Our smart glasses can also be used to easily scan all 1D and 2D barcodes, removing the need for bulky barcode scanners. We use a Bluetooth ring scanner to make the system even more ergonomic. This consigns the strain of bending down or stretching to scan difficult-to-reach barcodes to the past.
