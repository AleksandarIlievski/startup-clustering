Our battery-buffered ultra-fast charging solutions are a vital component for the electrification of transportation and the integration of renewable energy in our electric infrastructure without straining our grid. 
Our Green Transition Plan
ACCELERATING THE ULTRA-FAST CHARGING NETWORK 
Together, we need to expedite the process of identifying suitable locations for ultra-fast charging stations and swiftly deploy the necessary charging infrastructure. Our mission is to create a network of ultra-fast charging stations that is easily accessible and highly reliable. This requires teamwork with businesses, local governments and JOLT Energy to provide suitable locations for chargers. Let’s leave the worry about EV range behind us and focus on making ultra-fast charging more available than ever before.
