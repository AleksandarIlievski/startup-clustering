About us
viamon produces and sells security systems for photovoltaic power plants. The system consists of self-developed hardware and alarm response services. That way viamon secures and optimises the production of renewable energy. We are working together with EPCs, power plant operators (O&M), world’s leading insurance companies and PV-module manufacturers to secure both: large multi-MW power plants and smaller dedicated solar systems. viamon is one of the very few companies that focus on protection of PV modules and inverters.
Based on the experience we made in the core competencies of German Engineering, Security, Machine Controls and Internet of Things (IOT) we were the first ones to develop an integrated monitoring device of photovoltaic power plants. viamon's solution is GPS-based geo fencing anti-theft system.
So far our technology is installed since 2011 in Germany, Austria, Great Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Namibia, Ghana, Nigeria, Chile, India, China and the Dominican Republic and secures more than 200MWp of installed power plants.
