Next Level Optics
Enabling smart glasses that look and function like normal glasses
A decade ago, we started with a vision to upgrade all-day use prescription glasses with augmentation of virtual content. Today, we offer a customizable optical platform for smart glasses. Our tooz curved waveguide with proven mass-manufacturability is composed of FDA-approved polycarbonate. The curvature of the lens enables seamless integration of individual prescription.
Leading manufacturing capabilities
Right from the start of our unique waveguide development at ZEISS, we focused on highly scalable manufacturing processes and standards of the optics industry. We transferred the resulting design and engineering processes to leading edge tools for high-volume manufacturing.
At our tooz-owned production site in Germany, we control all process steps from injection molding, optical coating, filling and bonding to Rx-ing. We cover 100% of the value chain to provide leading edge optical engines for our customers.
