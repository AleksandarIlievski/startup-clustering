Very professional setup, communication, and workflows. I will definitely do business with Odys Global moving forward.Larrian Gillespie Csi★ ★ ★ ★ ★I have bought 2 sites from Odys Global and they have both been of high quality with great backlinks. I have used one as the basis for creating a new site with a great DR and the other is a redirect with again high DR backlinks. Other sites I have looked through have low quality backlinks, mostly spam. I highly recommend this company for reliable sites.Henry Fox★ ★ ★ ★ ★Great company!Vijai Chandrasekaran★ ★ ★ ★ ★I’ve bought over 30 domains from Odys Global in the last two years and I was always very satisfied. Besides great quality, niche-specific auction domains, Alex also helped me a lot with SEO and marketing strategies. Auction domains are not cheap, but quality comes with a price. If you have the budget and a working strategy, these domains will make you serious money.Keith★ ★ ★ ★ ★Earlier this year, I purchased an aged domain from Odys as part of a promo they’re running at the time. It was my first experience with buying an aged domain so I wanted to keep my spend low. I ended up getting a mid level DR domain for a good price. The domain had solid links from niche relevant high authority websites. I used the site as a 301 redirect to a blog I had recently started. Within a few weeks I enjoyed new traffic levels on my existing site. Happy to say that the Odys staff are friendly and helpful and they run a great business that is respected within the industry.Get In TouchWhether you're looking for help picking the right domain or need technical support, we're here to help.VitaliNataVadimContact UsWunderLoop.com€3,360Log In to Buy
