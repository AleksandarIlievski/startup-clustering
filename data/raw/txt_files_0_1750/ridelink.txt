Stephan Braisach
The mountains are on Graz's doorstep and I use every minute to experience nature on my motorcycle. RideLink makes my family feel more comfortable because they can see where I am at all times.
Patrick Dimster
For me, riding a motorcycle means switching off from everyday life. It gives me a feeling of freedom. As a young family man, I naturally also attach great importance to my safety. Especially when I ride alone, I always have my potential savior with me in Ridelink.
Patrick Ernst
The enthusiasm for perfection and the addiction to constant improvement is my motivator on the race track. RideLink shows my performance on the race track and helps me to experience my limit.
Jörg Majoli
I am professionally, for travel and adventure on the road with the motorcycle. That is clean prepare, that goes with Ridelink. If I am alone on the road and something happens, someone is notified. If I take people with me, I can track where they are and they know where I am so it's easier to stay together.
