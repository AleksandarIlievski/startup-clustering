ID, Access, Payment, Storage and Reward Functionspeaq provides five core open-source functions, critical to building any Machine dApp or DePIN.
Custom Tools, Apps & Interfacespeaq provides a range of custom tools, apps and interfaces with which to manage and control machine and tokens. Polkadot’s Internet of Things HubBringing millions of machines to the Polkadot ecosystem as independent economic agents, with $billions in associated liquidity.Ethereum & Substrate CompatibilityWrite smart contracts on peaq in either Solidity or Rust. peaq is built using Substrate and is EVM compatible.Machine NFTsProviding NFT features linked to Machine Identities enabling people to earn and having an interest in using them.Why do we need a Web3 Economy of Things?Our things are taking our jobs. Machines are becoming smarter and more able to perform tasks better, faster, and cheaper than humans ever could. They are becoming the primary workforce. peaq is leveraging Web3 to power a machine economy in which communities of people own, profit, and govern the machines that drive our collective future, together - without the need for centralized third parties. Why build on peaq?peaq leverages Machine NFTs to give people ownership, profit and governance rights over machines that use the dApps you build. peaq also leverages Machine DeFi to enable everyone - from investors, to machine owners, to manufacturers, to machines themselves - to directly benefit from machines providing services to people and other machines. When you build on peaq you build on a network that aligns everyone's incentives.A Community-Powered Economy of Thingspeaq enables people to own a share in machines and the Economy of Things. This has the effect of aligning people behind the goal of enabling machines to provide the best possible services to people and machines. Learn moreBringing Machine DeFi to PolkadotInteroperability is vital to success in Web3. To this end, peaq is built using Substrate and will run for Polkadot parachain. Polkadot provides the critical layer of security and interoperability beneath peaq that allows for seamless interoperability between all kinds of other Web3 projects as well as users and machines on other networks.RoadmapSwipe left for past, and right for future.Agung TestnetAgung TestnetAgung Testnetpeaq IDpeaq IDpeaq IDpeaq accesspeaq accesspeaq accesspeaq paypeaq paypeaq payEVM CompatibleEVM CompatibleEVM Compatiblepeaq apppeaq apppeaq appGaia X PortalGaia X PortalGaia X Portalpeaq ecosystem grant launchpeaq ecosystem grant launchpeaq ecosystem grant launchpeaq control betapeaq control betapeaq control betapeaq eot demopeaq eot demopeaq eot demokrest secures Kusama parachainkrest secures Kusama parachainkrest secures Kusama parachainyou’re hereHeadingLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
