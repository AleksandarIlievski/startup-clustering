With our experience and innovative technology, we strive to simplify satellite assembly, testing and integration processes and increase space ventures profitability. Founded in 2015, SPIN with its incredible team have worked tirelessly to bring the company to the forefront of the industry. We will continue to work relentlessly to democratize access to space by eliminating the hassle of standards compatibility and providing smart, affordable for companies of all sizes.Discover MA61CHome: About UsNEWSHome: ProjectsSPIN-1SPiN -1 announced a cubesat in orbit demo mission to demonstrate in-orbit reconfiguration and the benefits of modular satellite assembly with off-the-shelf components through MA61C, SPiN’s universal adapter. The satellite will be as large as 1U, reach an altitude between 300-500Km and it will be operational for 2 months. The mission is carried out in partnership with Telespazio Germany, Hyperion Technologies B.V., Crystalspace OU, NewSpace Systems and the Technical University of Munich, who provided essential hardware and software to the mission.PROJECTSSPiN works with industry, space agencies, research institutions and international organisations across the globe to develop a sustainable and cost efficient way to assemble sateliites.MODULAR ADCSThe Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) is the first close loop, stand alone system for small satellite based on a modular design. The modular ADCS is based on the MA61C smallsat and modular ADCS software that suits a wide range of missions, including Earth Observation (EO), Telecommunications and space transportation (space tugs). It is designed with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and currently reached TRL 5.SPIN - 1SPiN-1is a cubesat in orbit demo mission to demonstrate in-orbit reconfiguration and the benefits of modular satellite assembly with off-the-shelf components through MA61C, SPiN’s universal adapter.

The resulting re-design efforts are usually not negligible. A product like MA61C adapter would allow direct re-use of DSI products in different scenarios with minor changes, hence optimizing re-use costs! ”Elias Hashem, Business Development Manager at DSI GmbH“[MA61C] is a unique way to make standardization and plug and play happen”​Chad Anderson, Managing Director Space Angel NetworkHome: TestimonialsFollowContactma61c@spinintech.comAddressRobert-Bosch-Straße 7, 64293 Darmstadt, Germany©2022 by SPiNbottom of page
