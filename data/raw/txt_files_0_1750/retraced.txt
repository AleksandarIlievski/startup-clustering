“We see significant potential in retraced and their platform. This partnership enables us to provide instantaneous traceability details to our brand and retail partners. What may have taken days of searching through and consolidating documents can now be pulled in seconds.”
Michael Cai
Director of Operations and Supply chains at Décor Global
"With the implementation of the retraced platform, we can now effectively map and clearly manage our supply chains. On the one hand, this saves resources, and on the other, it enables us to show quite transparently where and how we produce. This makes our sustainability promise visible, so to speak."
Eva Englert
Sustainability Manager at WEITBLICK
"With retraced, we have a knowledgeable partner on our side that enables us to ideally complement our existing activities in sustainability management, to further strengthen our supplier network, to make our supply chains even more efficient and optimize them continuously."
Martin Löring
Division Manager Quality Assurance & Vendor Compliance at Galeria
“Sustainability and the claim to act responsibly are deeply anchored in our brand DNA. With the help of retraced, our goal is to enable  comprehensive transparency in and about the supply chain in the medium term and to set new standards in the industry.”​
Lissa Erlenkötter
Division Head Sustainable Sourcing, Buying & Production Knits at Marc O'Polo
"We see Retraced as an important partner on our journey to Re:generation. Retraced helps us bring transparency to our supply chain and its complexity, as well as capture, manage and make sense of all the important sustainability data and developments."​
Anna-Maria Wolter

"We are working with retraced to launch a traceability interface which is user-friendly and one which we hope will eventually become the most widely adopted by our fellow suppliers as well as our brand partners."
Omer Ahmed
