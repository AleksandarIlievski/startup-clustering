The studies using human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were tailored to our needs to provide results comparable to already existing (in house) data and the fast execution followed by a comprehensive study report completed the service perfectly.Nina GlaserHead of Early Safety ElectrophysiologyMerck Healthcare KGaAAs long as we do not allow cells in culture to behave like mature cells, we should not expect them to do so!Peter Linder MScCTO, FounderinnoVitro GmbHThe FLEXcyte brings another dimension to iPS-derived cardiomyocyte based assays. Measuring contractility in such a direct and easy way allows us to understand the cell functionality better and will help us in both our product development and safety pharmacology research.Choong-seong (Henry) Han DDS PhDCEO, FounderNEXEL Co., Ltd.Welcome to innoVitro – Your choice for high throughput contractility testing of cardiac and other human iPSC-derived cells!  innoVitro is a Contract Research Organisation based in Germany with core competences in measurement and analysis of cellular forces, in particular cardiac contraction of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The analysis is based on the FLEXcyte technology, a cutting-edge modern high throughput technique for the 21st century that overcame the limited cardiac contractility approaches of the Langendorff Heart, thus opened the door for fast and reliable cardiac risk assessment conducted for drug discovery as well as preclinical safety, toxicity and efficacy departments.Read moreBottom view of a FLEXcyte 96 Plate seeded with hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytesFLEXcyte Service – Let us do your contractility researchWe offer flexible contractility services - compound and / or cell type characterization - conducted for pre-clinical safety, toxicology and efficacy departments but also basic research. The studies are flexible in their design and include a comprehensive set of measureable parameters to support your in-house project and save your time and resources.Read moreFLEXcyte 96 Technology - Flexibility is key for a pro-maturation effectStandard cultivation methods do not provide the flexible environment cells would experience naturally. The FLEXcyte plates, produced by innoVitro, mimic the mechanical conditions of real biological tissue via hyperelastic silicone membranes that form a biohybrid with the cardiac tissue. This natural environment supports the development of a mature phenotype of cultured human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro. The pro-maturation effect, in combination with the higher throughput design, makes the FLEXcyte 96 the perfect tool for contractility research in the pre-clinical field.Read moreNewsCardiac Safety Committee Recognition Award 2022 -2023We are happy to announce innoVitro’s CTO Peter Linder has been awarded the HESI (Health and […]Meet us at the 2nd Microphysiological System World Summit in Berlin, Germany!The MPS conference will take place June 26 – 30, 2023 in the JW Marriott Hotel Berlin.
