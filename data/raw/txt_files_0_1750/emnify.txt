Frequently Asked Questions
                  What is an IoT eSIM card?
               
                     IoT – or M2M – eSIM cards provide access to cellular networks to connect devices – with a management platform to monitor and operate device connections at scale. If you want two or more ‘Things’ (connected devices) to communicate with each other, then you need a data connection. In most cases, a standard cellular mobile eSIM (or consumer eSIM) won’t cut it.
                  
                  How much does an IoT eSIM card cost?
               
The price can start from less than EUR 2 for a commercial-grade emnify IoT eSIM and less than EUR 3 for an industrial-grade emnify IoT eSIM depending on your order volume. A discount automatically applies as more eSIM cards are purchased within an order.
                  How safe are cellular networks for IoT?
               
Cellular networks automatically come with some advanced security features that make them well-suited for IoT. While any device can join a Wifi network, you can only connect to a cellular network with a compatible SIM card. Yet, with traditional cellular networks, the most significant security gap occurs when your devices communicate with the cloud. emnify closes this gap with Cloud Connect, keeping your connections private and secure.
                  Does emnify provide 24/7 support?
               
Yes. Whether you need technical support or basic customer service, we’re here to help any time, any day.
