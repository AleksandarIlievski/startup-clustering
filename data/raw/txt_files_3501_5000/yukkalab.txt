Testimonials
 
“The classic ESG indicators lag behind today's fast-moving, complex reality and display the past. Through YUKKA Lab´s unique AI we can provide real-time, news-based ESG scores along with the underlying news to our clients, so they can make faster and better investment decisions.”Daniel Andemeskel, Head of Innovation Management der Universal-Investment Group“20 years ago, a very senior Private Banker told us in a training for future private bankers „ private banking is all about emotions“. At the time, I was not exactly sure if I understood what he meant. In the meantime, I guess I figured it out. Empathy allows us to really understand our clients and this understanding helps us to find the best solution. The sentiment analysis from YukkaLab bridges the need for empathy to scalability. It provides the user with near to real-time information about current sentiments in financial markets - allowing the user to assess how clients might feel and therefore reach out in a pro-active manner”Matthias Plattner, Technologist“Thanks to YUKKA Lab, one is able to benefit from the unemotional evaluation of financial news and invest accordingly. It is a matter of recognizing early on when the huge turning points are reached in the market and to limit loss-making periods. All existing systems, robo advisor and algorithms mainly base their investment decisions on historic data sets. Here we are talking about real time analysis and news evaluation. In our opinion, this is an important game changer.”Steffen Bauke, CEO, Belvoir Capital AG
