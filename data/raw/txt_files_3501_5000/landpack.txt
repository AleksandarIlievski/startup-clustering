                            Resources                        
                            We replace fossil resources by using a local agricultural by-product as the primary raw material. Using this residue as a substitute for crude oil contributes to resource efficiency.                        
                            Local agriculture                        
                            Landpack straw comes from contract farmers in the surrounding area. This minimises transport distances and creates another source of income for our farmers in addition to grain yields.                         
                            Circular economy                        
                            From raw materials to processing with 100 % renewable energies and returning them to the natural cycle - a bio-based circular economy in which we give back to nature what is taken out.

SOCIAL: Strengthening local agriculture. Enables profitable grain cultivation for small full-time farms in the first place.
ECONOMIC: We grow organically and sustainably. Surpluses are reinvested.

                                The new German Packaging Act has been in force since 2019. The use of ecological packaging will finally be rewarded financially.
