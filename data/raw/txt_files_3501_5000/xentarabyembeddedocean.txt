Get on the fast track to smart manufacturing 
 For over a decade, people have been talking about the next industrial revolution, but industry leaders don’t feel like it’s happening. The Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is still in the proof-of-concept phase, data is often trapped in isolated systems, and popular terms like predictive maintenance are more hype than reality.This is because decision-makers want to modernize, but they can’t ignore the economic realities of their businesses. Many factories have a mix of old and new machines, which can make implementing modern sensor technology difficult. Retrofit solutions often don’t work well and don’t take full advantage of data. Even in new projects, incompatible technology standards can be a barrier to data-driven improvements. 
Does the slow adoption of technology mean that we must wait for the future to come gradually? Absolutely not! 
 
Legacy 
Existing PLC  technology providers are sticking to legacy hardware concepts.  
 
Cloud 
If modernization is approached at all, the Cloud is promising to solve it all – however, typical requirements of equipment providers and operators are left out. 
 
Customer 
Total transparency is threatening the machine builder’s business model.

There is no single path to smart production. Depending on their individual requirements or production environment, manufacurers seek different approaches and use cases to use their data. XENTARA lays the foundation for realizing scenarios that generate a particularly high benefit and contribute to the big picture – the transformation of your industry.

Data Processing 
OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is the a way of measuring manufacturing productivity, often described as the gold standard for productivity improvement. It is expressed most simply as a percentage showing how much of the time spent on production actually results in good products. So a factory that works with no interruptions, at fastest speed, and does not produce faulty products, has an OEE rating of 100%:100% Quality (no bad parts produced)100% Availability (no interruptions or downtime)100% Performance (all processes running at the highest speed possible)By monitoring your production data through Xentara, you can easily set up OEE calculations and see your OEE score in realtime!Click here to read more.

More Features of the Plattform 
XENTARA is an integrated software-based platform that brings together all dimensions of smart production. Use all the possibilities of smart manufacturing and “liquify” the data of the entire shopfloor.  
 
 CUSTOM AI 
Use AI and machine learning wherever your data is processed. At the edge, on your own server or in the cloud. This enables shop floor operators to achieve better value for less investment. 
 
OPEN INTERFACE 
XENTARA connects to a wide-range of fieldbuses and protocols. Any existing ERP, MES, CAQ or BI solution can be integrated. 
 
REALLY REAL-TIME: 
Your data is not available in an hour or the next day but: immediately and at the same moment. This is how you create the prerequisite for immediate and further usage scenarios from your valuable data. 
 
SKILL STORE 
XENTARA can be enhanced in every imaginable direction through skills and add-ons from our skill store – for example, by adding new protocols or machine learning scenarios. This way we meet every current and future use case
