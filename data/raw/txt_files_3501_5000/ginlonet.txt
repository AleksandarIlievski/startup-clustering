Why organisations choose ginlo 
Care services 
For staff outside the office, conversations and video chats with patients – including the exchange of data this requires – is quicker, easier and more cost-effective, while still conforming with data protection regulations and keeping administrative staff in the loop. 
Local government offices 
An important example of how ginlo can be used is for contact between the authorities and asylum seekers. It can be used to answer general questions, provide information on authorities, and arrange applications and appointments – confidentially and in compliance with GDPR. 
Youth welfare organisations 
In their day-to-day work with children, young people and families, youth welfare organisations deal with particularly sensitive information. In addition to functions like video chat, our confidential messenger offers secure data transfer as standard – for a price that organisations can afford. 
Doctors 
A digital solution for medical practitioners offers improved accessibility to doctors, video appointments for initial assessments, increased efficiency when prioritising patients and planning appointments, reduced waiting times and shorter turnaround times for medical certificates and documentation – all while meeting data protection requirements.
