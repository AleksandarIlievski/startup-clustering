Bringing pathologyinto the future.
One out of every two people will receive a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime. Through technology and innovation, we’re fighting uncertainty, removing human error and ensuring that every cancer test is quick, safe and reliable.
Solving an age old problem.
Since the invention of modern sample testing over 100 years ago, doctors and scientists have struggled with collecting, transporting and delivering quality samples. Studies show that anywhere from 1-15% of tissue samples still get mixed up, contaminated or lost during the first stage of diagnosis. From biopsy to slide, inveox enables faster and more reliable cancer diagnoses through a digitalized, fully-automated and integrated histopathology process.
How it works
From biopsy to diagnosis…
The doctor collects a sample from a patient
The doctor places the sample into our intelligent container
How it looks today
The doctor registers the sample in our digital invorder system and sends to the lab
Physician puts samples in containers and documents manually
The sample arrives safely at the destination lab
The order entry lab software registers the incoming sample, automates the selection of stains, and processes other relevant information input by the doctor
And ID assignation to containers and documents
The samplex machine scans IDs, takes pictures, characterizes, registers and organizes samples per case 
Manual triage containers by cases
The cassette marking module (CMM) will automatically label data using the laser onto the cassettes 
Cassette printing and matching with containers
The sample transfer module (STM) automatically transfers samples from containers to the corresponding cassettes
Manual transfer of samples from containers to cassettes
The sample is analyzed and results are shared instantly via invorder (KIS API) with doctors

Voices of inveox.
Whether it’s patients, relatives, doctors or lab technicians who are directly or indirectly impacted by inveox, our Pathology ecosystem is saving lives, one sample at a time.
I estimate that the inveox’system speeds up our sample extraction process by 10 to 20 percent.

Traditionally, the process has always been mostly manual. So we looked for a connection to the lab that was more direct.
