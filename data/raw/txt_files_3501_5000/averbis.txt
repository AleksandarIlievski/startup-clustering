Our cutting-edge technologies
Searching through your treasure trove of data requires vast amounts of time and resources and leads to no success? It is statistically proven that over 80% of your business-relevant information is hidden in unstructured data. And new information is added every day! Your data, in structured form, is worth its weight in gold, as this is what makes it usable in the first place. Lift this ‚Äúdata treasure‚Äù with our cutting-edge technologies!
Text Mining
Using text mining, our solution structures all your documents, literature, or patient reports for you. Natural Language Processing analyzes, classifies and catalogs them. In the future, benefit from comprehensive insights and precise predictions from your entire data treasure trove through our text mining tools ‚Äì quickly and accurately.
This technology means enormous benefits for medical research, billing automation, literature research, side effect monitoring and patent monitoring.
Machine Learning
Your expert and inside knowledge trains our software. Machine Learning makes the automatic classification of documents easy, fast and accurate. The system automates a large part of your work, leaving you time for the important things.
Semantic Search
Sometimes you‚Äôre looking for a needle in a haystack. We help you with that! With our semantic search, you can quickly find the information you need in your document collection. Our solution also recognizes synonyms and sub-terms, making your work easier, thanks to high precision and an amazing completeness.
Terminology Management
Do you use special terminologies in your work environment? Our solution takes this into account as well. Terminology Management allows you to maintain and expand external and internal terminologies and ontologies. Term hierarchies help to organize individual subject areas linguistically and formally, and establish rules about the relationships between the respective terms.
