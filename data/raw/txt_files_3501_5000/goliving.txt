Bureaucracy, dispersed information, high set up costs and difficult flatmates. With a hassle free sign up process, standardised design and a community of like-minded people, Habyt aims at creating the best housing experience, anywhere. We started with one apartment in Berlin, we now have hundreds of rooms in multiple cities and we plan on offering a great housing experience to an ever increasing number of people across the globe.Learn more about usLocationsBerlinBarcelonaMadridLisbonMilanCompanyAboutCareersTermsImprintPrivacyPressPartnershipsLandlordsUniversitiesCorporatesEnglishEnglishEspañolItaliano© 2020 Habyt.
