The payment terms are as follows: we offer NET30 terms, meaning payment is due 30 days after invoice is created automatically by our system. We pay via bank transfer or PayPal, with a minimum amount of $25. For those who prefer to use Bitcoin payments, we have a minimum requirement of $100.

Our surveys are designed to engage B2C audiences and focus on topics such as consumer purchasing decisions, brand awareness, and perspectives towards new products. CPX Research “Smart Match” technology automatically matches user profiles with surveys and filters out surveys that are not likely to convert well. Users are only presented with the most relevant and engaging content.
