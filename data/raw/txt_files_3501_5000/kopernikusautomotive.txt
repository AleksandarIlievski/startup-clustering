AVP Type 2 TechnologyConnecting the Dots for the Future of Autonomous DrivingWATCH IN ACTIONOur TechnologyKopernikus Automotive is the leading developer in AVP type 2 (automated valet parking) technology. AVP2 technology is a smart infrastructure-based approach to autonomous driving.USE CASESA red question mark
Why is AVP2 technology important?We fast-track the arrival of autonomous driving. Today’s serial production cars are not yet capable of fully driving autonomously. So we set out to reverse the paradigm: We build a smart infrastructure that can remotely drive any serial production car today. Our technology that way sets the stage for automated infrastructure-based driving (AVP2 technology) in production, logistics, repair, and parking use cases.

How do we do it?We equip any facility’s infrastructure with the necessary sensors and processing power to make AVP2 technology possible. The cars become autonomous by merely embedding the Kopernikus software into existing onboard ECUs. The AI-based perception and path planning are performed externally. All automated driving commands are sent to the car wirelessly in real-time.TechnologyA graph with an arrow pointing to an upward trend
What is the result?Our technology immediately increases efficiency, lowers the operating costs and improves the usability for the facility operator. In factories and car logistics we free up labor resources, in a repair facility we increase the efficiency of the workers. In a parking facility we increase the convenience for the end customer, while massively improving the efficiency for the parking operator. About usWe Have a Passion for Autonomous Cars!About UsKopernikus Automotive was founded in 2016 by car enthusiasts Stefan Jenzowsky and Tim von Törne and is headquartered in Leipzig, Germany with an R&D Center in Berlin.
