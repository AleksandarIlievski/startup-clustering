It’s like Magic.87% of all textiles used for clothing eventually end up in landfills or incinerators. It is our mission to change this. Using our patent-pending, award winning process, we recycle unwanted textiles into a new material. Our material replaces oil based plastics and can be used to produce anything from eyewear to clothing hangers. By doing so, we save textiles from landfills and replace the need of plastics at the same time.
    Our Material
  
 
We save 2.5kg of CO2e for every kilogram of material produced.
