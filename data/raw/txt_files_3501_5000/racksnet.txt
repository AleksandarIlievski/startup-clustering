You decide how you want to use the racksnet® solution. Only one location central or for several locations worldwide.
  
Single-Site Solution
For small and medium-sized enterprises with only one campus network
More tasks lead to more complexity. This increases the risk of losing the overview of your network system. By integrating the racksnet® SDN controller, you ensure that your network infrastructure is reliably tracked and mapped in the software at all times.

Multi-Site Solution
For medium and large companies with distributed network infrastructure
Distributed network infrastructures are best managed with multiple SDN controllers. This allows you to automate sites independently or, e.g., through cloning, and to replicate and roll out to new branches according to your compliance.

racksnet® offers you more efficiency than other solutions in all aspects, whether monitoring, management or automation. And the best thing is: racksnet® combines all this in an integrated, unique all-in-one solution. So instead of many vendor-specific individual programs, you will only need one tool in the future.
With the racksnet® solution you make your company fit today for the challenges of tomorrow, e.g. Brite-Box solutions with Open Networking operating systems like Microsoft SONiC.
