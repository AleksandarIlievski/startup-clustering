Marie-Laurence (21)
Canadian volunteer in Costa Rica
“
                            I learned a lot during this project. It was awesome; I would go back anytime. The accommodation is great, we are just in front of the beach and it's nice to be really disconnected. Seeing my first turtle made me so happy.

Rigmor (17)
Danish volunteer in South Africa
“
                            Never had I ever thought this trip would be so amazing! I can't believe it's been 4 weeks at the wildlife reserve already, time flies when you're in good company! No words will ever be enough to explain how much I enjoyed it!

Brad Brasseur (32)
Canadian Volunteer in Peru
“
                            Education gives people in poverty the skills to not only earn money but also improve their basic daily knowledge. It is a sustainable tool that does not only help someone for one day but rather a lifetime and can be passed down to generations.
