Shaping Magnetic FieldsWhat we doWe are an MRI technology company focused on magnetic field homogeneity for MRI applications. We develop add-on devices for MRI machines, which recover the image around challenging areas or implants and substantially improve multi-parametric MRI applications.
​
Our vision is to create better images for all MRI scanners, reduce MRI manufacturing complexity/cost and increase space in the MRI bore by enhancing the current shim technology.
 
We provide solutions for all magnetic field strengths, all MRI vendors, and both animal and human applications.
​
We constantly develop and improve our products with the latest state-of-the-art technologies.Inhomogeneous magnetic fieldHomogeneous magnetic fieldHow it worksMRI scanners rely on a homogeneous magnetic field for good quality images. The process of homogenising magnetic fields is called shimming.
​
Since electrical currents generate magnetic fields, the magnetic field distortions in MRI scanners can be corrected using shim coils.
​
We design and manufacture cutting-edge shim coils and shim amplifiers leveraging industry 4.0 technology and a range of other products to improve the performance of MRI scanners.Our Research is Supported by:Funded by
