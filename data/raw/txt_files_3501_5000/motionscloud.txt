During the phone call, Jack gets an SMS/ email with a unique link to start the digital claims process.   Jack received an SMS/ email with a unique link of an Augmented Reality (AR) mobile photo web app to start streamlined and automated digital claim process.  The white labeled and personalized AR mobile web app lets Jack capture pictures with AR guidelines through the web browser without downloading and installing any app.    AI computer vision damage assessment comes into play to pre-scan the pictures and generates a pre-assessment report for the claims manager to make a settlement decision.     The claims manager receives the AI pre-assessment report, reviews and makes the decision in less than 5 mins.  For slightly complicated cases, inspections would be necessary for verification and clarification. This can be done through a live video inspection module without visiting Jack. Pictures are taken in HD, audio, and video are recorded.   Once it is verified and approved by claims manager, the repair shop would start the repair of the vehicle right away.
