Benefits of Embedded Deep Learning Vision AI 
Embedded Vision AI brings the power of Deep Learning from the cloud to the Edge. It enables responsive real-time AI applications as images are processed immediately on-device. It does not only respect data privacy by design as no image data is being sent to the cloud, but by leveraging energy-efficient Edge hardware it also drastically reduces the energy footprint.
