OUR LEARNING MODEL
  
PEER LEARNING
You learn programming by collaborating with other students. Having no teachers, means that projects are evaluated through peer review. 
PROJECT BASED LEARNING
Learn by doing. The curriculum consists of high quality and up-to-date projects which are constantly innovated by a group of experts. 
REAL-WORLD SKILLS
Develop soft skills needed in working life such as adaptability, critical thinking, collaboration and learning to learn. 
GAMIFICATION
Instead of slaying dragons, you slay projects. You progress through the curriculum with experience points and levels instead of years and semesters. 
24/7 ACCESSIBLE CAMPUS 
The campus is designed to make connections, learn programming, create music and play games. We believe in the power of co-creation beyond the screen!

WHAT OUR STUDENTS SAY
Mohan, 26
Former IT student
This is the first time in my life that I really enjoy learning. At my old university, I didn't understand everything the professors lectured because it was too theoretical. I am a practically oriented person. I have to do it myself, make my own mistakes, to understand everything completely.
During the 4-week piscine of 42 Heilbronn, I learned much more than in one semester at university. 
Sonja, 30
Former tax consultant
Before I started at 42 Heilbronn, I had no coding experience. I was afraid that I would feel stupid. But the opposite was the case: my peers helped me at all times. I get the support no matter what level I'm at - without being judged.
42 doesn't feel like a normal school. You don't come here to get a degree. You come here because you really want to learn something. 
Marius, 29
Former Campus Security
42 is not just a school for me, it's a lifestyle. Mainly because of the freedom you have here in almost everything you do. The flexible opening hours allow you to come to campus whenever it's most productive for you. I am enjoying collaborative learning for the first time in my life, and the community has definitely become a cornerstone for me. It's a great place to build a network and good contacts for the future. 
Svenja, 19
Recently finished school
The main difference to school is that really all students want to be here. That creates a positive atmosphere at 42 Heilbronn. Everyone is open to getting in touch with each other. Here at 42, you have the freedom to try out different things, see how they work and thus find the right solutions. Also, my peers are all very different. It's amazing what cool concepts come up when two different people with different mindsets and approaches come together and work.
