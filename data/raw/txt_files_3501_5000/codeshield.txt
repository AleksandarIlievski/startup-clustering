We didn’t know about some of our exposures before we started using it.Jannik WeichertCo-Founder & CTO, EdyoucatedI recently had the opportunity to use CodeShield in my AWS security assessments where it supported me as whitebox cloud pentest.
One notable example involved the detection of a potential attack scenario, where an attacker could have exploited a vulnerable Lambda function to gain unintended access to the entire AWS account.Victor GrenuFounder & CEO, zoph.ioCloud Change SimulationSimulate the IAM permission changes on your CloudCloud IAM is complex. Service control policies, permission boundaries, resource- and identity-based policies define an invisible access network in your cloud. Analysing only the infrastructure-as-code is insufficient as it represents only a small fraction of the network - the actual referenced cloud resources are missing.CodeShield analyses cloud and code changes to show the effective IAM permissions pre-deployment in your development workflow. It simulates the impact of your infrastructure-as-code changes to all your cloud resources - to your Lambdas, S3 buckets or DynamoDBs.CVE-2021-44228Try it out Speed up Cloud DevelopmentDetect Breaking Changes Pre-DeploymentChoose the right-sized permission sets and avoid over- and under-permissioning of your IAM permissions. Avoid breaking changes as of missing access rights in your cloud.CodeShield lists all effectively granted access to your cloud resources.Increase Security PostureDetect Over-Permissioned IAM rolesLoosely defined IAM policies are a severe security risk and easily allow intruders to compromise data, increase your cloud bill or takeover your entire AWS infrastructure.CodeShield evaluates all your cloud permissions and showcases IAM privilege escalation scenarios to your environment. For every attack scenario, CodeShield depicts which concrete cloud resources are at risk, this allows one to quickly identify which escalation to prioritize.Recent postsCheck out our latest postsSep 06, 2022Cloud Security Posture Management, Cloud Identity Entitlement Management - and CodeShield?In this post, I want to explain the difference between CodeShield and other cloud security solutions.
