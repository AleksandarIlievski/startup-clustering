AboutIn addition to its eponymous jewellery lines, VOJD works with luxury fashion labels such as Kenzo, Acne Studios, Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Alexander McQueen, Akris and Carolina Herrera on integrating 3d printing in their collections creating accessories, jewellery and garments unprecedented in shape, structure and texture.
