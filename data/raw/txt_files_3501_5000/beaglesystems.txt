ABOUT DAASDrone-as-a-ServiceAt Beagle Systems GmbH, we are making any place on Earth accessible at the press of a button. With our network of long-range BVLOS drones we can offer services with a 50x higher resolution than commercially available satellite data 
(optical and IR) with less than 24h lead time. 
 
We understand that traditional drone solutions are hard to acquire, install and operate, especially on a large scale and with beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) capability. 
 
Our aim is to keep risk and OPEX low for our customers, while delivering data (or airlifted goods) to stakeholders in rapid time. 
​
Become a part of our growing network!Approved for Flights in the EU!Among the first in Germany, Beagle received approval for flight operations under the new EU-law.
The permit allows us to perform long range drone flights over rural areas anywhere in the European Union without pilot on site (“BVLOS”).Back to top
