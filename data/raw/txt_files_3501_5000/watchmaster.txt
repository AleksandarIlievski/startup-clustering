Why sell with Watchmaster? Get a free quote >>
No matter the reason you want to sell your watch, we offer you the most convenient way to do so. Let us evaluate your watch at no cost, have it picked up fully insured at a time of your preference by a UPS courier at Watchmaster's expense, have it reconditioned by our in-house watchmakers and then sold. The payout is made immediately after a successful sale.
You have the choice between a direct sale, a commission sale and a trade-in. When you trade in your watch with us, you will not only receive the top price for your old watch, but also an upgrade to the alternative you desire. With Watchmaster you can be sure that you will get the highest possible price for your watch.
During the entire sales process, your luxury watch is 100% insured and your personal watch consultant will keep you informed on the status of your timepiece.
 
Our watchmakers clear any wear marks to increase your watch’s value.
 
We market your watch to consumers and retailers in over 35 countries.
 
Our experts do the hard work, from photo shooting to collecting the payment.

The Watchmaster certificate

Buy or finance your luxury watch with Watchmaster
Pre-owned, vintage or unworn? Which watch fits you the best?
Whether as an investment or an everyday companion, a good watch will stay by your side and perform its job for decades. So why not buy a pre-owned watch and save several hundred euros?
Pre-owned watches
Similar to a used car, it is the same with a pre-owned luxury watch. You are not the first owner, but you still enjoy all the advantages of the gem you bought: brand name, appearance, functionality and quality. Compared to purchasing a new watch, buying a used luxury watch offers one decisive advantage: the price. If you choose a pre-owned watch  from  Watchmaster,  you  can  save  a  lot  compared  to  the  original  price  without sacrificing quality. We guarantee this with the Watchmaster certificate and a 24-month guarantee.
Unworn watches
With  an  unworn  watch,  you  buy  a  timepiece  that  has  never  been  worn  before.  This means that you are not the first owner, but you are the first person to actually wear the watch. Buying a new watch from Watchmaster can save you money and time as many of the watches in our range are ready for immediate dispatch. You will be able to hold your  new  luxury  watch  in  your  hands  in  a  timely  manner  –  no  waiting  for  months  or years.
Vintage watches
Are you looking for a very specific style and prefer a vintage and retro look over modern watches?  Then  take  a  look  at  our  large  selection  of  vintage  models.  With  a  vintage watch,  you  always  buy  a  piece  of  history  and  become  part  of  it  by  wearing  such  a timepiece. Despite their age, our vintage luxury watches are, of course, fully functional, refurbished and fully secured by our two-year guarantee. Place a piece of history and tradition on your wrist and invest in one of the many vintage luxury watches from our shop.
