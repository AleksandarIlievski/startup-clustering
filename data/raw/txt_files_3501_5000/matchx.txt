        "MXC mining using the M2PRO has been a life changer for me. In my opinion the M2PRO is the best crypto miner all around. I originally invested and got 1 miner and then I made my money back on that investment in about 4 months. Then I bought some more and I just keep getting more and more. "

        I always thought the crypto miners are noisy and high energy consuming but M2 Pro Miner changed that consept for me. For more than one a year I have it and honestly sometimes I even forgot that its in my house, making me everyday MXC and BTC silently :)

        The installation went suprisingly smoothly and was very simple. The MXC app is also very user friendly. I knew how it worked now so i ordered some more miners and did the same. Setup took 5 minutes and the miner started doing his job. I bought a few more.  I'm very satisfied and this miner is higly recommended
