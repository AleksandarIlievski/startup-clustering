Face Anonymization
With increasing capabilities of facial recognition technology, public video data collection comes with great risks. brighter AI’s Precision Blur is the most accurate face redaction solution in the world. Deep Natural Anonymization (DNAT) is a unique privacy solution based on generative AI. It creates non-reversible synthetic face overlays to protect individuals from recognition, while preserving data quality and accuracy for analytics and machine learning.
