About the technology
Areas of application
The h-aero® is a data collector from the air. It can be equipped with various sensors and cover different areas of application. Possible areas of application are observation (fire monitoring, environmental damage, agricultural cultivation, etc.), industrial inspection (bridges, tunnels, monument protection and industrial plants, etc.) and monitoring of large areas. Digitalisation also plays a major role: the launcher systems are connected to the internet and are able to perform autonomous flight sequences, whether via WLAN or mobile networks.

More about us
We offer our customers a new option of obtaining data from the air and try out ideas with them, some of our own and some we have brought along, in order to bring about significant potential cost reductions in various industrial processes. This results in prototypes and results that can then be rolled out after the results have confirmed the assumption.
