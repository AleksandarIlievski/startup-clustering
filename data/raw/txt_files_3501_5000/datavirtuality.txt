Voices of Our Customers 
						Having Data Virtuality in place for years, we feel that it is the data foundation to help the company leverage the data assets. It is the last piece of the puzzle in solving all of our data challenges. With Data Virtuality, our BI department became a flexible one stop shop for everything data and more. The other teams at Renew Financial know that they can rely on us delivering the right data in a very fast development time, five times faster to be precise.					
Mai DoanDirector of BI at Renew Financial 
						Data Virtuality is so easy to use that even our business analysts can use it and get the data whenever they need it. Before Data Virtuality only our developers could use the tool and the business analysts had to wait. Now that the developers as well as business analysts can use the solution, we are not only more efficient but were able to cut cost by 80%!					
Fred DunantDMO Manager at Crédit Agricole 
						Data Virtuality has made the data analytics team so much more efficient and effective. It allows us to do more than we could have done with any other kind of technology. I wish I would have been aware of data virtualization and specifically Data Virtuality years ago. Because of its capability it makes my life so much easier.					
Frank NoordoverDirector of Data Management at Swanson Health 
						With Data Virtuality, we are very flexible and scalable now! We can easily unlock new data sources, quickly implement changes, and get comprehensive insights of different parts of our business. The demand for data has risen - exponentially it seems.					
Sjors TakesLead Data Solutions Architect at Albelli 
						With the help of the Data Virtuality Logical Data Warehouse we brought multiple sources together and we managed to create data marts which contain data from a lot of sources, ready to be used. And once we connected the LDW to our BI tools for analysis we already reduced a lot of dependency on us. And now, instead of downloading data from different sources, and then joining and cleaning them e.g. in Excel, we simply have these tables ready-made in Data Virtuality.
