Faster time-to-insight on R&D and business 
Mergeflow uses AI-augmented analytics to help you discover companies, emerging technologies, market estimates, R&D experts and other insights in worldwide technology contents. 
Getting a 360° view of a technology field 
What companies are active in a technology field? What’s the latest in R&D? What are relevant markets? Who invests in the technology field? What topics are discussed in the news and on blogs?
Mergeflow’s 360° view helps you address these and other questions, so that you can quickly identify those areas that are worth your time.

Staying up-to-date on your technology fields 
New technology developments can emerge at any time, anywhere. But nobody can predict where and when this will happen. And even if nothing happens for a while – you still have to be on the lookout, just in case.
Mergeflow automates this otherwise time-consuming process for you. It tracks and aggregates the latest venture investments, R&D, patents, news, and market analyses. And on a weekly basis, you’ll get relevant updates via email. You can stay up-to-date in minutes, instead of spending hours scanning multiple databases, websites, and portals.

Analyzing a company from a science, technology, and market viewpoint 
This helps you understand the potential of the company in the long term. As an investor, it lets you assess the potential of the company to develop new products, services, and technologies. Additionally, it helps you identify the competitive advantages that the company has over its competitors.

Exploring your customers' markets 
Exploring which markets are relevant to your customers can help you discover new opportunities, assess customer needs and adjust your products or services accordingly to better meet those needs. It also helps you to identify potential changes in the market and adjust your strategies accordingly.
For instance, if you make LiDAR technology, you should be aware of fast-growing markets in which your customers might use it. You could target fast-growing markets since they are probably a priority for your customers.
