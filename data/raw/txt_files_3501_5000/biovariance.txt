About Biovariance
BioVariance was founded in 2013 with the aim of quantifying biomedical variance in order to enable better treatment of diseases. At BioVariance, highly qualified teams of biologists, data scientists, software developers and lab technicians, supported by our professional management team, work to translate research results into practical solutions that will improve quality of life for people undergoing medical care.
 
 
BioVariance works closely in collaboration with hospitals, universities, diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, plus various patient organizations, in order to achieve the goal of making all diseases as treatable as the common cold.

Career 
Become a BioVarian 
Our work has international relevance. That’s why we don’t need a big city office with subway access or a convenience store on the corner. We are located in the countryside. In the border region to the Czech Republic. Here, there are poor bus connections and at best a gas station that is open on Sundays. But you already knew that, didn’t you?
 
 
What matters to us: We analyze individual patient data, enabling precise diagnostics and therapy – particularly in the case of cancer. And for that, we need you.
