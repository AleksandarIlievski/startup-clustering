Sneaker News
We are Grailify
Until sneaker news manage to make their way into the "official" news portals, one or the other sole will probably
have to be worn off. But never mind, because we are working on it! Grailify offers news for sneakerheads, fashion
mongers, smart dressers and everyone who often feels happy when they see new sneakers. Since we not only know this
feeling, but also love to experience it ourselves, we have set up
a sneaker release calendar. Of course, we will let
you participate! Sneakerheads stick together. Constantly making the sneaker fanbase grow with the help of the latest
sneaker news, is something like family reunification for us.
Our Sneaker News+: Information about coupons, raffles and promotions
With Grailify you will always find all the release dates of new sneakers with pictures as well as the most
important
information: What distinguishes the new sneakers? What colorways are they available in? Where can I buy the new
beauties in store or online? Who offers sneaker coupons or raffles? Of course, we also provide you with the right
links and tell you what we think of the release. For each new shoe, we also list comparable products at the end of
the
pages – always according to the motto: “one pair more beautiful than the other!” So if you are looking for a new
pair
of sneakers: take some time. On Grailify you will not only find sneaker news, but you can also be guided from one
shoe
to another.
With our sneaker news you determine what you want to read
Therefore, we have not only set up a “Sneaker Looki Looki” (search mask on the top right), but also numerous
categories with which you can quickly and precisely find the sneaker news about the manufacturer or brand that you
are
looking for. In our sneaker sale area you can check at a glance where you can find the currently cheapest Nike sale,
adidas sale or simply the best deal in the most popular sneaker and streetwear stores.
And if you already know exactly which manufacturer and which brand it must be for the next pair of sneakers, you
can
use the menu area (green bar at the top) to display all releases of the respective shoe at a glance. With just a few
clicks you can buy a Yeezy online and thanks to the accompanying sneaker news you are sure to choose the version
that
you like best. After all, there is hardly anything more annoying than finding out out that there is still a colorway
that you would have liked better…
Say “Bye” to such shopping mistakes. Our sneaker news will provide you with comprehensive information. If you want,
we will send you all the latest sneaker news via our popular Grailify App. Simply download our free app for Android
&
iOS. As soon as a requested model is available again, you will automatically receive a message. So we give you the
best chance to cop your personal grail (yup, that’s where our name comes from). Of course you will also find the
corresponding sneaker news on Grailify.com.
Sneaker news from “Psst … have you heard?” to “just in”
There are many names for sneakers. Grannies and Grandads somewhat questioning looks can usually be brightened up
quickly by using the word “trainers”, while with dads and mums a word like “sports shoes” guides the conversation in
the right direction. In contrast, eloquent contemporaries draw the right conclusions for syllables such as kicks,
joggers, takkies or chucks. Our beloved shoes with rubber soles are not only diverse, but also very polyglott!
In order to do justice to this, we have come up with a blog that we have filled with sneaker news from all over the
world. You will find the latest rumours as well as pictures of first look announcements and everything that we have
just picked up for you from the sneaker scene.
