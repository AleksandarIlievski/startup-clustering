THE POWER OF POINT CLOUDS
3D point clouds serve as precise models of reality, available at low costs, and perfectly suited for high-performance processing.
Capture assets, sites, and entire environments 1:1 every year, every month, every day, every hour, every minute, or every second.
Run spatial analytics based on 3D point cloud streams that continuously deliver billions of data points.
Perform feature detection and differential analysis as core algorithms operating on 3D point clouds.
Build a unique spatio-temporal model of reality with 4D point clouds, combining 3D point clouds captured at different points in time.

ABOUT US
Point Cloud Technology GmbH, founded in 2015, offers a universal platform for big data analytics on 3D point clouds based on machine learning. Our platform is used by organizations across various sectors including manufacturing, design, surveying, asset management, transport infrastructure, real estate management, insurance and the public sector.
CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS
Funded by the BMVI, Point Cloud Technology is launching a 3-year project together with the city of Essen, the Hasso Plattner Institute and Straßen NRW to create a comprehensive national infrastructure database for roads. The database includes road inventory as well as an assessment of the condition of roads and their substructure. The data basis comprises 3D point clouds, image data and ground radar data which are collected with mobile mapping vehicles and analyzed using artificial intelligence.
