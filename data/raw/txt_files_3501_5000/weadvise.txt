                        Highly adaptive to the needs of your business
                    
                        Our technology is completely adaptable to the “look & feel” of your own corporate identity.
                        We enable you to promote your own wealth management strategies without losing the interface to
                        the customer.
                    
                        Independent of banks and asset managers
                    
                        With our modular platform, you decide which investment products you offer. WeAdvise acts independently
                        of banks or product manufacturers. Upon request, we are also able to integrate your preferred partner bank.
                    
                        Immediately ready-to-use
                    
                        With the help of our scalable plug-and-play-platform you do not lose time-to-market. We lower
                        development and operating costs compared to an in-house development.
                    
                        Regulatory compliance combined with a maximum level of IT-security
                    
                        We constantly monitor our solution to ensure full regulatory compliance – this is contractually
                        guaranteed to our clients. All data is hosted at high-security data centers and therefore meets the
                        highest IT security requirements.
