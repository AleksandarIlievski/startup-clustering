What Our Clients Say About Us
Isabella ThissenSenior Vice President Editorial Products & Innovation RTL
Factors such as the timing of the go-live in combination with the rebranding and the establishment of the hub, which required equal treatment of topics, significantly expanded the scope of this project, so we wanted to rely on a strong partner. We already had very good experiences with Appsfactory as a full-service provider on another project for TVNOW, soon RTL+. That's why we wanted the colleagues on board again this time.
Julia VogelTeam Leader Product Management Beurer Connect
"The creativity during product conception and the professional, personal support give me as a customer a feeling of certainty that achieving a successful product is possible."
Anna LandstorferTeam Lead Product App at Condé Nast
"Top developers and a top team to implement new ideas and tackle problems. I can only recommend Appsfactory as an agency."
Kevin TöpferManaging Director BUWOG Group GmbH
"[...] With the customer app, we are setting a new milestone in terms of service orientation, because it provides more transparency, efficiency, easy self-services, and completely new practical possibilities for proactive communication with us. We consciously decided to develop an app based on a white-label concept, and we are pleased to have created a digital product together with Appsfactory that provides a scalable and efficient solution for our customers - tenants and property owners - as well as our employees."
Marcel BährAdministrator Application Management | Project Leader ASEL
The work on the project "Automatic Speech Recognition Solution (ASEL)" is a lot of fun with all participants and is also very productive, so that we have already achieved a lot after 1  1/2 years of project duration. Even for critical issues, a good solution has always been found in the past, in joint discussions. This would probably not have been possible in this way with another development partner. For these reasons, I look forward to further cooperation. :-)
