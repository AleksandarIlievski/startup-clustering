YOUR LAUNCH 
 
INTO THE NEW SPACE 
We are reducing launch costs in the space industry, democratizing access to space. Real-time satellite-based data will soon form the backbone of our industry, research and society. If we want to understand, protect and connect our planet Earth, we need to go into space.

OUR VISION
 
WE BUILD ROCKETS
 
JUST LIKE CARS 
We build the best and most low-cost rocket – our RFA ONE. Our engine technology with staged combustion is revolutionary and far superior. We maximize the cost advantages of serial production because we build rockets just like cars.  
OUR MISSION
 
ENJOY OUR LAST MILE 
DELIVERY SERVICE 
With our orbital stage, we position our customers exactly where they want to go. Our last-mile delivery service supports any mission profile from LEO to GTO and beyond to enable ambitious business and scientific goals.
