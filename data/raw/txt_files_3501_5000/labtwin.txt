Frequently asked questions
          View all FAQS→
Is LabTwin an ELN?
While LabTwin could be used as an ELN solution for real-time documentation, LabTwin has been built primarily to offer scientists an intuitive and easy way to interact with all their lab systems through our Open API. We have already proven integration with top ELNs used in the Pharma industry.
Can LabTwin support accents or other languages?
The base of our language algorithm is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) layer which gives LabTwin the flexibility necessary to understand different accents. In the LabTwin team, we have at least 22 different nationalities and everyone is testing our voice-user interface with their accent to ensure the highest accuracy. LabTwin is currently been used in both English and German but we can develop new language models on demand.
How does LabTwin understand scientific jargon?
Compared to traditional voice-controlled digital assistants (Alexa, Siri, ...), LabTwin’s NLP model is trained to understand scientific and lab technology terms and formats (such as units). It can be further trained on specific terminologies used by each client. Moreover, LabTwin’s AI voice assistant is built to support scientific workflows and provides the dedicated framework to capture and structure lab data as well as connect to lab hardware and software.
How are you using client's data?
Clients’ data are only used to train our language model for their own use of LabTwin.LabTwin achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2017 and ISO/IEC 27017:2015 certifications. These certifications recognize LabTwin’s compliance with international gold standards for information security.LabTwin’s model is trained every day from scratch using a combination of public scientific data and client’s proprietary data. Once a contract with a client is terminated, all proprietary data can be deleted from the system. For some clients, we are setting up a separate model to ensure extra data privacy.
