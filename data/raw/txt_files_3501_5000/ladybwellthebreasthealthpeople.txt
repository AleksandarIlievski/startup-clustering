Bio
Creator of India’s leading on-location Breast Health Education & Digital Screening program.
Born and raised between the Czech and German immigrant settled farming communities of Praha and Freyburg, Texas, Carman moved to Czech Republic in 2004 during a 18 year senior executive career for a Fortune 300 company. With travels to over 80 countries and friendships around the world, he cofounded a digital diagnostics company in Bengaluru on International Women’s Day in 2015.
After creating India’s first “We Come to You” Breast Screening business, today Carman exerts full passion to end the world’s worst cancer affliction – Needless Breast Cancer. His wife and three kids are his biggest supporters.
Carman launched LADY B WELL – THE BREAST HEALTH PEOPLE to rapidly expand the reach and impact with a “train the trainer” model fashioned to offer a customized & sustainable women’s health experience.
