Our Smart Service Modules

Whether you need to perform a service call at the customer's site, technical acceptance of a plant or machine, training for users, outdoor or indoor installation. With ADTANCE Support you get a fully comprehensive solution and can do all this work remotely. 
Workflow
ADTANCE Workflow allows you to digitize, analyze and optimize all work processes. The process data are made available to your employees via mobile devices - the workflow is improved decisively.

Visualisation & Monitoring
Process Visualisation & Monitoring offers you the possibility of constantly monitoring machines and plants via sensors. You have control over your processes as well as limit and measured values. 
Document Management
Store documents centrally in one place and control access rights - so your colleagues, partners and customers have access to the latest version of all relevant information at all times. 
Predictive Maintenance
Individual machines or systems are constantly monitored with the aid of sensors. This allows you to detect potential problems in good time and avoid production downtimes.
