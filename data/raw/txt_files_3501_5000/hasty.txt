Accelerate
Reduce your time to deployment by 40% with model insights from the beginning to enable agile workflows.        
End-to-end
Our wholly integrated solution allows you to focus on building the application rather then maintaining a “Frankensuite” of tools.        
Secure
Our secure platform has strong data protection right - providing a safe, complete technical solution for your competitive advantage.        
"Hasty.ai helped us improve our ML workflow by 40%, which is fantastic. It reduced our overall investment by 90% to get high-quality annotations and an initial model."
Dr. Alexander Roth
Head of Engineering at Bayer Crop Sciences
"Modern tools like Hasty are very accessible for everyone at Element Six to harness the power of AI with a relatively low investment"
Tanmay Rajpathak
Applications engineer at Element Six
"Because of Hasty, PathSpot has been able to accelerate development of key features. Open communication and clear dialog with the team has allowed our engineers to focus. The rapid iteration and strong feedback loop mirrors our culture of a fast-moving technology company."
Alex Barteau
Senior Computer Engineer at PathSpot Technologies
"Hasty has taken our data labeling to the edge. Both semantic and bounding box labeling has gone from weeks or months on our large data sets to days. For QA, I just reviewed 19,000 labels in 5 hours. WTF!"
Shane Prukop
CEO at TruPart Manufacturing
"Before discovering Hasty, labeling images was labor intensive, time-consuming, and less accurate. Hasty’s approach of training the model while labeling with faster annotate-test cycles has saved Audere countless hours."
Jenny Abrahamson
Software Engineer at Audere

We come from German manufacturing
Before founding Hasty in 2019, we worked with many manufacturing companies on a range of vision AI applications. Our CTO came up with the idea of using AI to train AI while we were facing the challenges of applying ML in the real world. We have been in your position, and we catered to the most discerning customers: German manufacturers.
