Tok­eniza­tion as a Ser­vice® 
							BLACK MANTA CAPITAL PARTNERS ARE A BAFIN-REGULATED AND MIFID II-COMPLIANT FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTION: A ONE-STOP AGENCY FOR ALL TECHNICAL, FINANCIAL, AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF TOKENIZATION. WITH SECURITY TOKENS THAT GRANT EQUITY, PROFIT, AND PERSPECTIVELY GOVERNANCE RIGHTS TO INVESTORS, WE AIM TO SET A GLOBAL STANDARD FOR SECURITY TOKEN OFFERINGS (STO). 
							What does Tok­eniza­tion actu­al­ly mean? It is quite sim­ple: With Tok­eniza­tion we con­vert rights to an asset into a dig­i­tal token, to be spe­cif­ic, we cre­ate smart invest­ment con­tracts on a blockchain. An entire­ly new access to cap­i­tal is here­by estab­lished for inno­v­a­tive start-ups, small and medi­um-sized busi­ness­es, real estate projects, com­mod­i­ty mar­kets, or funds.

ideas, growth, val­ues 
							STARTUP 
							Every entre­pre­neur starts with an idea.Every ven­ture starts with cap­i­tal. Every enter­prise, from the garage start­up to the glob­al cor­po­ra­tion, runs on mon­ey. In order to bring prod­ucts or ser­vices to their mar­kets, entre­pre­neurs need cap­i­tal. Sure enough, liq­uid­i­ty has always been a core busi­ness chal­lenge. Today, a Secu­ri­ty Token Offer­ing (STO) is noth­ing less than the next gen­er­a­tion Ven­ture Cap­i­tal on blockchain. 
							
 
the next generation,
the next inno­va­tion 
							SMALL & MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES 
							Every small and medi­um-sized busi­ness faces chal­lenges of financ­ing the next step, the next inno­va­tion, the next mar­ket to con­quer. Today, a Secu­ri­ty Token Offer­ing (STO) is noth­ing less than the most flex­i­ble source of cap­i­tal for future invest­ments. Tai­lor your cap­i­tal need! 
							
 
Tok­enized 
							REAL ESTATE 
							By means of Tok­eniza­tion, real estate own­er­ship final­ly enters the dig­i­tal age. A Secu­ri­ty Token that rep­re­sents own­er­ship in a real estate inter­est means high flex­i­bil­i­ty. Its trad­abil­i­ty and the con­cept of frac­tion­al own­er­ship will be a game chang­er for the future of project development. 
* For BMCP, poten­tial projects start above a cap­i­tal need of EUR 5 mil­lion. 
							
 
Tok­enized 
							COMMO-DITIES 
							COMMODITIES 
							Rethink liq­uid­i­ty. By means of Tok­eniza­tion, the glob­al com­mod­i­ty mar­kets final­ly enters a new lev­el of dig­i­tal­iza­tion. A Secu­ri­ty Token that rep­re­sents own­er­ship in a com­mod­i­ty means enhanced flex­i­bil­i­ty. Its trad­abil­i­ty and the con­cept of frac­tion­al own­er­ship will be a game chang­er for the future of com­mod­i­ty trad­ing. 
							
 
Tok­enized
