How do diseases develop? How can we treat them? In order to answer these big questions, we need to start small. We need to understand the tiny building blocks: molecules. How big are they? What is their structure? How do they interact with each other? The answers to these questions will guide us towards new and improved medicines to treat diseases like cancer.At Dynamic Biosensors, we have made it our mission to support scientists in this endeavor and to help accelerate the drug discovery process.To fulfil this, we developed switchSENSE® and Real-Time Interaction Cytometry (RT-IC) – two groundbreaking technologies that enable researchers to characterize molecular interactions in unequaled detail.​  VIROLOGY  IMMUNOTHERAPY ONCOLOGY DRUG DISCOVERY & UNDRUGGABLE TARGETS NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES ENVIRONMENTALTOXICOLOGY RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES BACTERIAdynamicBIOSENSORS technologies for molecular interaction analysis feature unparalleled analytical capabilities, enabling the development and manufacturing of future drugs.  OurProducts Made for high-performance analysis.MOLECULE-MOLECULE INTERACTIONS→ switchSENSE® technology→ heliX / heliX+ biosensor instruments (switchSENSE® compatible)→ heliX chip→ Consumables→ heliOS softwareMOLECULE-CELL INTERACTIONS→ RT-IC technology→ heliXcyto instrument (RT-IC compatible)→ heliXcyto chip→ heliOS softwarePURE PROTEIN-DNA CONJUGATES→ proFIRE® instrument → Antibody-oligonucleotide conjugation→ His-tagged proteins conjugation „switchSENSE® allows us to measure affinity and kinetics of DNA-binding proteins which we are unable to analyze  with any other method.“Dr. Michael Schraeml, Head Protein and Enzyme Technologies ROCHE DIAGNOSTICS GMBHIn focus. Browse through the latest publications.Publication in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences I 13 January 2023 (open access)The Impact of Nε-Acryloyllysine Piperazides on the Conformational Dynamics of Transglutaminase 2Congratulations to Andreas Heerwig et al. for their recent publication in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences!They used switchSENSE® to investigate the influence of irreversibly binding inhibitors on the conformational equilibrium of transglutaminase 2. The measurements show that binding of nucleotides, specifically of GTPγS, leads to a more compact conformation, whereas binding of Ca2+  induces a conformational change towards an elongated open conformation. Binding of the inhibitors shifts the conformational equilibrium to more open states. switchSENSE® was demonstrated to resolve conformational remodeling that could not be resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.READ MOREPaper in Communications Biology I 07 October 2022 (open access)Multivalent Binding Kinetics Resolved by Fluorescence Proximity SensingCongratulations to Clemens Schulte and our collaborators from Hans Maric’s group at the University of Würzburg for their latest work on multimeric peptides.They investigated peptide-based effectors inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) and demonstrated the value of switchSENSE® to analyse structure-activity relationships. They synthesized >100 unique multivalent peptide binders and used switchSENSE® to systematically evaluate their binding kinetics.In this paper they show that specific peptide architectures influence the binding dynamics, which enabled them to identify highly inhibitory peptides. The binding affinity was increased for higher-order multimers, which was mainly driven by increased on-rates. Precise on- and off-rate determination is thus key to engineer optimized multivalent binders.switchSENSE® was demonstrated to be a viable method for high-throughput PPI characterization in order to optimize peptide architectures and engineer most efficient multivalent effectors. More specifically, switchSENSE® showed superior accuracy and low sample consumption when compared to alternative biophysical methods.READ MOREPaper in Scientific Reports I 27 July 2022 (open access)Characterization of binding interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and DNA-peptide nanostructuresCongratulations to Marlen Kruse and all collaborators from Ralph Hölzel’s group at Fraunhofer Institute to their interesting publication in Scientific Reports.They investigated the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor hACE2. To do so, they prepared trivalent DNA-peptide nanostructures to achieve a trimeric hACE2 peptide presentation. switchSENSE® was used to examine the binding of full-length spike protein, subdomains and even whole virus particles. They show that small changes in the amino acid sequence of the spike protein can drastically influence the binding behavior. Furthermore, they demonstrate an increased affinity of the protein to the trivalent peptide construct as compared to single peptides. Finally, they detect different binding behaviors of several pseudo virus models of the Alpha and Beta variants of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the inactivated wild type virus.This study shows the versatility of the switchSENSE® technology, which enables the investigation of multivalent interactions and the utilization of a broad range of analytes from protein subdomains to whole virus particles.READ MORE→ click here for a list of all switchSENSE® publications.NEWS. Press Release I 01 September 20222bind and Dynamic Biosensors sign technology-service partnershipMunich, Germany, and Regensburg, Germany, 01 September 2022 – Dynamic Biosensors and 2bind, a Contract Research Organization (CRO), today announce that they have signed a technology-service partnership which will enable both companies to further help their customers to accelerate research. The collaboration will enable 2bind to integrate Dynamic Biosensors’ innovative heliX® system into its service portfolio, giving Dynamic Biosensors another highly experienced partner in the areas of certified services and beta-testing of future technologies.2bind is a highly respected CRO focused on early-stage drug discovery and antibody development, with more than 10 years’ market experience. Its customers will benefit from innovative biophysical binding assays based on Dynamic Biosensor’s proprietary switchSENSE® technology, which leverages DNA nanolevers to determine the size and shape of biomolecules.Thomas Schubert, CEO of 2bind, commented: “2bind has built up a unique portfolio of biophysical methods and assays to offer customized outsourcing solutions in early drug discovery and antibody development. By integrating Dynamic Biosensors’ cutting-edge heliX® biosensor system, we are gaining another powerful tool to meet our customers’ needs and enhance their research capabilities. The innovative switchSENSE® technology features one of the broadest application ranges of any bioanalytical tool. In addition to direct kinetic binding analysis, it provides detection of avidity / cooperative binding and formation of ternary complexes, which are especially useful for programs involving bi-specific antibodies or PROTAC/molecular glue compounds. The heliX®  biosensor also enables the monitoring of conformational changes in proteins, induced for example upon ligand binding. These versatile analysis modes will enrich 2bind’s hit validation capabilities in small molecule and antibody discovery programs. 2bind is proud to become a certified service provider for Dynamic Biosensors’ innovative products and we look forward to driving scientific advances through our expertise in biophysics.”The partnership positions 2bind as a trusted service partner for the switchSENSE® technology and as a development site for beta-testing novel developments aimed at strengthening Dynamic Biosensors’ product portfolio with cutting-edge tools for biomolecular interaction analysis.Ralf Strasser, COO of Dynamic Biosensors, said: “2bind and Dynamic Biosensors share a strong commitment to helping our customers achieve scientific breakthroughs. This agreement underlines the importance of early drug discovery for our business. The high-quality information offered by switchSENSE®   also helps lower the attrition rate for drug candidates in later, more expensive stages of drug development. Partnering with 2bind supports our mission to bring innovative methodologies to the market and to drive the expansion of the heliX® biosensor system by demonstrating its benefits to researchers around the world.” Media Contactmedia@dynamic-biosensors.com+49 89 89 74 544 – 20 About Dynamic BiosensorsDynamic Biosensors is a provider of instruments, consumables, and services in the field of analytical systems for the characterization of biomolecules and molecular interactions.
