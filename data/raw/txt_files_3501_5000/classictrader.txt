Classic Cars for Sale - Buy Your Favorite Classic Car from any Era
A new car is a milestone in everyone's life and often seen as a kind of companion by the owner. Classic cars are a popular choice for people who prefer vehicles with personality and style instead of technically advanced novelty’s. In our shop, you can browse through past eras of the automobile culture and find European vintage cars in many different styles for sale. The categories are segmented by the different types of vehicle bodies, which makes it easy to find your personal frontrunner or a new treasure for your garage. In the summary below we shine a light on all the information you need to choose the perfect Classic Car for Sale for nostalgic feelings on the street. 
Classic Cars from old and modern Eras – A Travel through Time
Welcome to the world of classic cars and antique cars! On our marketplace, we offer a huge assortment of Classic Cars from different manufacturers and decades. Horses, flashpoints and stars are popular motives you may encounter - Classic Cars were made as lifestyle products once and not just as technical status symbols. Share some good taste on the street and show the style you identify with the most. We make it easy to obtain European and American cars including insurance and shipping issues. 
The Emergence of a new Cult in Society - Classic Cars as Status Symbols
In 1885, Carl Benz turned over a new leaf in the history of mobility and was granted a patent for the first automobile. The technique evolved with new makes and models like the Ford Tin Lizzie and the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL over the past 100 years. Some of the tedious models from the past turned into popular classic Car models over the years - European cars like the Volkswagen Beetle, Citroen 2CV or Jaguar XK and other "oldies" are good examples for this nostalgic value. 
Over 2.500 manufacturers produced a countless number of different car models over the past 100 years. It is not that easy to tell what makes a certain car so special, even decades after the production shut down. Sometimes it depends on the car body as such, sometimes a famous driver increased the popularity of a certain car model. Good examples for cars that made an astonishing image change are the European Opel Kadett or classic muscle cars from the US. Those pragmatic but fuel consuming cars were widely disliked for years - today, there is a huge fan community for old and restored muscle cars and standard models from Europe and they are popular collectibles for every automobile fan. 
A definition for classic cars and antique cars
The term “Classic Car” refers to a car that has been brought on stream at least 30 years ago. Antiquities that count as "Vintage" are often part of a country's cultural history and become symbols of certain decades and lifestyles. The classic cars combine history, art and tradition on four wheels which makes them a highlight wherever they are seen. There are various reasons and pro arguments for people to buy a classic car for daily usage or as a second car for special trips on the street: For some people it is a clever investment, other people love the feeling of driving such an old treasure and a few hobby-workers like to lose themselves in the restoration of classic cars. The possibilities for individual self-fulfilment are countless: Limited editions of various manufacturers, British roadsters or Italian convertibles are just a few examples for passionate collectors. On the Classic Trader Marketplace you can find classic cars for sale to complete your international collection with rare models from every continent. 
Find your personal treasure
The benefit of buying an outrunning model is the high potential of a valuable investment over a relatively short period of time - cars that are relatively keen today could become valuable classic cars in the future. Other classic cars for sale are already real treasures with a stable value that is permanently rising. Of course, a classic car is not something you park on the street for a longer period of time: Before you purchase your favorite model, you should make sure to have enough space for a long-time storage. If you happen to be lucky enough to find a functioning model, you should regularly maintain the sensitive technique to keep it that way. Spare parts are very expensive and difficult to obtain, so you should try to avoid unnecessary attrition. 
Pre-war Cars for sale - not outdated at all
Many brilliant designs and manufacturers already established before WWII and unfortunately faded into obscurity due to worldwide cultural changes. The famous Bentley Blower for example was not very popular in the 1920's and 1930's, but today it is a downright attraction in every private or public collection of classic cars. Owners of a Riley, Mercedes-Benz, Alvis or Rolls-Royce vintage cars can be sure to find numerous interested purchasers anytime. The classic cars are historical witnesses of certain time periods and make every trip on the street an outstanding event for the driver and for everyone on the street. 
Post-War Classic Cars for Sale
After WWII, cars became lifestyle products and stood for individual fulfillment and personal liberty. Reconstruction and redevelopment were central values in post-war societies, where people mainly worked on improving the economy and their personal mobility. In West Germany, the VW Beetle, the BMW Isetta and the Citroën 2CV were the first affordable models for the middle class, moreover upper class models like the Mercedes-Benz SL started their worldwide success story. At the same time, British manufacturers built classic legends like the Aston Martin DB5, the Austin-Healey 3000 and the Triumph TR3. A rare treasure from that period is the Jaguar XK 120, a powerful and elegantly designed roadster. American muscle cars from the 1960's like the Cadillac DeVille came to fame due to their striking tail fins. A popular car model and an eternal symbol for the hippie-lifestyle is the VW T1 Bus, also called "Bulli" in Europe. The Citroën DS (named "The Goddess" by collectors) is a French model which was very popular in its days and is still asked today. 
Antique cars from around the world
Some car models came to worldwide fame and pertain as everlasting status symbols. Upcoming prosperity in Europe after WWII rapidly increased the popularity of sporty cars and manufacturers focused on models especially designed for high driving enjoyment. British roadsters from the 1950's and the 1960's offer low comfort but people back then and today love the feeling of driving the sporty cars. The same is true for Italian models - some limited Ferrari editions belong to the most sought-after antiquities in the world. German manufacturers became a great part of the automobile history - classic car models from Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are masterpieces of European car engineering and stand out because of the advanced and efficient technique. On Classic Trader, you will find classic cars for sale from nearly every country or offer treasures from your own garage. 
Celebrities and their iconic classic cars
Many cars come to fame because of a certain connection to famous celebrities or movies. The DeLorean DMC-12 from “Back to the Future”, James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 or the VW Beetle named "Herbie" are good examples for cars we know from the screen. A treasure from the American film history is the Ford Gran Torino - Clint Eastwood used it as a central allegorical element in the eponymous movie, years after “Starsky and Hutch” made it a cult object. Other models like James Dean's Porsche 550 Spyder are associated with tragic fates and therefore became collector’s items. The atmosphere that surrounds a certain car depends on the people and events it is associated with. Find a model that fits your style in our selected assortment of antique vehicles from every decade and in every shape.
