We are here to connect the world. We are ngena.
Agnostic of networking technology, cloud provider or telecommunication carrier we provide secure connectivity as a Service to any location in the world.
Using the most advanced connectivity platform, ngena accelerates cloud transformation, improves cyber-security and enables enterprise digitalization at low cost and high speed
Download Company Overview
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secure
 
As digitalization brings enterprises beyond their traditional borders, with business-critical intelligence running in the cloud while workforce and decision makers operate from the most disparate locations.
 
 
Connectivity
 
…their success is predicated upon the ability to securely connect business tools, data and people with the speed, flexibility and global reach their business demands.
 
 
Platform
 
…and as the world evolves quickly, enterprises need to evolve at the same pace, leveraging ready to use, proven, future proof and cost effective solutions that solve the complexity of this new word for them, allowing them to put their resources and talents on their own business.
 
 
 
 
  
ngena In Action
 
 
 
ngena has recently been named the 6th hottest network startup of 2022 by CRN. We're honored to be recognized for our achievements, and thankful to everyone involved in helping meet our mission of simplifying secure connectivity and digital transformation on a global scale. 
 
 
 
 
 
Fortinet is a known industry leader providing secure SDWAN to customers in all vertical markets.  For ngena this is a strong partnership that allows us to expand our Secure Connectivity solutions with a vendor that is recognized as a frontrunner in security services. 
 
 
 
 
 
In our continuing effort to offer our partners the best possible solution for their client in the digitalization era ngena is proud to welcome Versa Networks as part of our multi-tech offering. Any technology - Any network - Any cloud - all in one platform
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Why ngena?
At ngena, we believe that digitization is the driving force of the new economy, and that automation and managed services are the most efficient, cost effective and future-proof route to enable enterprises to enter the global and flexible economy enabled by digital transformation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Borderless business
Digital transformation allows enterprises of any size to operate globally and, at the same time, have the best enabling technology immediately available through the cloud. Enjoying the full potential of this cloud-based economy is predicated upon ubiquitous connectivity that is both reliable and cost effective.
 
 
 
Enable talent where it is
Remote workforce is a key asset to enterprises, both to leverage the best talents wherever they are, and to be resilient to disruptions. Guaranteeing the same employee experience whether your employees are at office, at home or on the road is key to enable everyone to contribute at their best, wherever they are.
 
 
 
Security everywhere, as your business needs it
While intellectual property is increasingly dispersed over the cloud or roaming laptops, some industries need to retain a significant amount of centralized information. Security must be effective whether the data are on-prem or in the cloud, at rest or in motion, tailoring itself to the nature of each specific business.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your evolution from classical IT into the digitized world requires evolving your connectivity and security infrastructure
 
To get the best out of the new technology and to take advantage of best-in-class technology providers. This evolution means reshaping your operations to deal with a completely new operating paradigm and needs to happen quickly to beat competition, nimbly to keep pace with your business needs, and with a cost model that supports your business and helps you achieve your financial targets.

Frequently Asked Questions
 
 
I don’t know ngena. Can I really entrust my global network to them?
 
The Challenge

You need a trustworthy and reliable partner who has proven skills and a longstanding track record to guarantee the highest quality for all your network services, including world-class security and service levels agreements.

Already more than 50 enterprises are running key parts of their networks on ngena’s platform.
 
 
Can I build a global SD-WAN using just a single provider?
 
The Challenge
According to recent surveys, 41% of businesses globally say they do business in countries outside their own. This means that, at many companies, network operations must be seen as a global task. Unfortunately, however, setting up, managing and monitoring global networks 24/7 still remains highly complex. This also implies that many members of your IT department are tied up with time-consuming activities such as multi-provider management and incident resolution. In addition, the complexity of global networks traditionally leads to a very slow roll-out of new sites, and limited flexibility in implementing change requests and network optimizations.
The Solution
The ngena Secure Connectivity as a Service was developed to cope with these requirements. It offers you a global SASE & SD-WAN from a single source – your trusted local provider that is a member of the ngena partner ecosystem. This is possible because ngena has formed an ecosystem of 30+ leading telecommunication providers that offer their Ethernet and Internet access in around 200 territories worldwide to give your company truly global connectivity. Along with the strength of the global ecosystem comes the power of a global platform and the .connect with a central portal that enables ngena ecosystem partners to design, order, set-up, monitor and maintain global SD-WANs with a click of a mouse. The use of innovative abstraction, virtualisation and a data- & model-driven end-to-end orchestration now allows global enterprise networks to be rolled out more quickly, and with greater flexibility to change or upgrade services in response to prevailing business needs.
 
 
Show all questions
Can I improve my network performance and simultaneously reduce costs?
 
The Challenge
Many companies are under great pressure to cut costs and optimize their investments in CAPEX and OPEX. At the same time, bandwidth demand is continually rising especially due to new Cloud and IoT applications and an increasing level of digitalization. Companies are therefore seeking new technologies that can increase their network performance while
simultaneously keeping down their costs.
The Solution
Today’s SD-WAN technologies already come with significant cost advantages if set up correctly. The ngena solution was built, in particular, to further optimize your enterprise’s network performance, and help you save money. As ngena offers cost-efficient hybrid Ethernet and Internet access, we estimate you can save 20% and more, just by replacing high cost MPLS lines with a cheaper access mix, i.e. a truly hybrid network. Moreover, the available bandwidth in ngena’s networks is typically higher because of an »active-active« vs. traditional »active-standby/backup« network designs, which means you can almost double your useable bandwidth without doubling cost. Compared with classical MPLS solutions, SD-WAN comes with additional functions at no or low additional cost: for example, you can retire expensive hardware devices for security or network visibility solutions and replace them with Virtual Network Functions instead. As ngena’s solution is a fully-managed service, our Secure Connectivity as-a-Service approach can help your company slash its operating costs by allowing your IT staff to concentrate on more urgent business needs, rather than managing the technical configuration of your network – which is then taken care of by ngena and its ecosystem partners. Overall, depending of the amount of integrated services and additional value-add, we estimate that with the ngena solution your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) can be cut by 30% and more.
 
 
I’d like to roll out or upgrade my global network now. Can Ngena help me reduce 
installation time?
 
The Challenge
Today, a change to an existing enterprise network or the addition of new company sites can be very time consuming. Especially when you are using a relatively inflexible MPLS network, it can take months until new office locations or remote workforces can be added to your global WAN. The complexity is even higher when it comes to Mergers & Acquisitions and two separate company networks have to be merged into one. Especially when you are not using a fully managed service, your ICT teams can be overloaded with work. But as installation time is business-critical and influences your time-to-market, it’s crucial for your business to find a faster solution.
The Solution
The ngena service has been designed to reduce enterprise-network installation times by automating network configuration and maintenance tasks. Today, ngena can bring a medium-sized enterprise network into service within two weeks of receiving an order. Assuming the availability of Internet connectivity, and that the Customer Premise Equipments (CPEs) can be shipped in time. Network upgrades with private or additional Internet links can than follow in a second step. ngena uses a zero-touch provisioning process to add new sites or make changes to existing network architectures. This means that, once the CPE has arrived at your office, it auto-configures on power-up and no specialist skills are needed on-site; as long as the device can be plugged into its supply and the network cable is attached, the service is configured centrally. New branch offices will be online almost instantaneously, thereby significantly increasing the productivity of your company.
 
 
Can ngena help me see what’s going on in my network and monitor the status of my network health?
 
The Challenge
Today, it is often quite difficult to keep track of the status of your global Virtual Private Network (VPN) and to oversee what is going on in your company’s network. Monitoring your network health status is either not possible or can only be done by adding costly, additional hardware to your network operation center. But monitoring your network health status is essential if you are to avoid or mitigate operational disruptions and downtimes. In addition, you want to better understand which applications are driving your enterprise’s bandwidth demands, and where potential bottlenecks lead to poor performance and lower user satisfaction.
The Solution
ngena’s Secure Connectivity as a Service comes with sophisticated, built-in monitoring capabilities and dashboards that show you the health status of your global network in real-time within .connect. By using the leading-edge network analytics, your network services can be monitored and supervised in real-time. In addition, you can check whether all technical key performance indicators are within or outside the target values. Performance graphs show you the different health statuses over time, and help you identify potential bottlenecks or weaknesses. Should any incidents or major irregularities occur, an alarm will be triggered, and you will be notified immediately. Moreover, being able to see what is going on in every part of your global network will also allow you to improve the stability and reliability of your network and improve user satisfaction.
 
 
Can I make my network more efficient by securely offloading data to the Internet?
 
The Challenge
Today, Internet data represent a high percentage of your company’s WAN traffic and consume a huge amount of bandwidth. This type of traffic is constantly growing due to the usage of more and more Cloud based applications, such as Microsoft Office365 or Salesforce.com. In traditional VPNs, the Internet traffic is often backhauled from branch offices to a distant headquarter. But wouldn’t it make more sense to offload this Internet traffic locally instead of jamming your global WAN with it?
The Solution
Based on your company’s traffic profile, you can have the ideal access designs customized according to each site’s needs. This is because ngena offers a choice of single or redundant Internet Public Lines or Private Lines. These access designs come in easy-to-understand T-shirt size concepts from XS to XL+, giving your company the flexibility to select exactly the design needed for the traffic profile and level of redundancy of any office type – from a branch office to a data center or central headquarter. Along with this, ngena offers multiple ways of offloading business data to the Internet. You can use either Local Internet breakout directly from your sites, or utilize regional, secure Internet Breakout via ngena’s secure data centers. ngena edge routers provides a stateful firewall for direct outbound Internet access. Furthermore, up to advanced security with URL Filtering Malware protection we offer a direct integration to Zscaler’s or Cisco Umbrella’s Cloud gateway to enable secure local Internet access. With ngena’s suite of Cloud connectivity options and different access types to connect to the Internet, enterprises can reap the benefits of Cloud applications without having to worry about security or performance.
