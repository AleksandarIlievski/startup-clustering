"Use, function, charm and responsibility - JEEVES, the first service robot for the European and soon also international hotel industry, convinced in these aspects at this year's Red Dot Design Award.”

"Whether in a nursing home, hospital or supermarket, robots keep their distance and don't infect anyone.”
                                                        
"Computer-aided services are more in demand and more important than ever in times of Corona.
