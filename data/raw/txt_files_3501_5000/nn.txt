Power to the technical people n8n allows you to build flexible workflows focused on deep data integration. And with sharable templates and a user-friendly UI, the less technical people on your team can collaborate on them too. Unlike other tools, complexity is not a limitation. So you can build whatever you want ‚Äî without stressing over budget.         
          Build custom scenarios at speed
         You can implement multiple triggers. Branch and merge your workflows. And even pause flows to wait for external events.
          Code when you need, no code when you don‚Äôt¬†
         Connect APIs with no code to automate basic tasks. Or write vanilla Javascript when you need to manipulate complex data.
          Independent instances for each environment
         Avoid breaking live workflows by separating dev and prod environments with unique sets of auth data.
          Integrate with any app
         Interface easily with any API or service with custom HTTP requests.
          Painless debugging
         See the execution data of every workflow. Integrate error nodes into workflows to catch errors. And rerun individual nodes to test fixes fast.
          Bulk operations¬†
         n8n nodes let you process data at scale with a built-in iteration functionality in every node.
          Host on your own infrastructure
         Fully on-prem for those that need the security
