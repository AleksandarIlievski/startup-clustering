                The annual returns shown were calculated using simulations based
                on historical values over the last ten years. For the
                simulation, the historical daily closing prices from 07/29/2011
                to 07/29/2021 of the MSCI World, S&P 500, MSCI EU, MSCI EM, MSCI
                JP, Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate and FTSE EMU Gov. Bond
                indices were used. The use of both normally distributed returns
                and observed returns resulted in identical return results for
                1,000,000 simulated 10-year investment cycles. Shown here is the
                95% quantile for good performance, the 50% quantile for medium
                performance, and the 5% quantile for poor performance. Return
                developments below the 5% quantile and above the 95% quantile
                are also possible with low probability. The indices used here to
                calculate returns will not be directly included in the UnitPlus
                portfolios, but are for illustrative purposes only.
                Additionally, UnitPlus costs and ETF costs are not included in
                the calculation. The weighting used here reflects the weighting
                of UnitPlus’ Mount Everest Portfolio, which invests 90% in
                equities and 10% in bonds.
              
                  Investing involves risks and can lead to a total loss of the
                  capital invested. A positive return is not guaranteed and
                  historical return performance is no guarantee for the future.
                
          Building wealth has never been
          so easy plus flexible.
          From an innovative alternative to an overnight deposit account to a
          long-term investment, UnitPlus is multifaceted and optimally tailored
          to your personal goals.

Christian RebernikSerial entrepreneur
                Money in the checking account loses value. UnitPlus changes
                that. Money is invested but available with the debit card. I
                invested because there is a great team behind it and I use
                UnitPlus myself.
              
Brigitte ZypriesFormer federal minister
                From the very beginning, I was convinced that UnitPlus gives
                everyone in Germany the opportunity to invest with a focus on
                returns and still remain flexible.
              
Martin ZielkeFormer CEO Commerzbank AG
                As a former banker, I know how valuable savings deposits can be
                for banks. However, the banks only pass on the resulting returns
                to savers to a very limited extent. UnitPlus is turning this way
                of thinking around and wants to encourage more savers to invest
                smartly and flexibly with its globally innovative product.

Assumptions and risk note
x
              For the calculation of the potential returns the historical daily closing prices from July 29, 2011 to July 29, 2021 of the MSCI World, S&P 500, MSCI EU, MSCI EM, MSCI JP, Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate and FTSE EMU Gov. Bond indices were used and a weighted average was calculated. Thus, over the past 10 years, the exemplary portfolio strategy Zugspitze has returned an average of 5.8% per year, Mont Blanc of 6.4%, Kilimanjaro of 7.4% and Mount Everest 7.9% before costs. The corresponding indices will not be directly included in the UnitPlus portfolios and are for illustrative purposes only.            
                Investing involves risks and can lead to a total loss of the capital invested. A positive return is not guaranteed and historical return performance is no guarantee for the future.
