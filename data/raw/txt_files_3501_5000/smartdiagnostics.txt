It is all about the quality of medical decisions
Smart4Diagnostics closes the preanalytical data gap between blood collection and lab analysis and enables a new quality standard for diagnostic decision making.

We change preanalytics from trust-based into an evidence-based system
Our digital human sample fingerprint is a quantum leap forward for patient safety, preanalytical quality and lab turnaround time. We create a trustworthy basis for the personalized medicine of the future.
Data-Driven Preanalytics
More than 70% of all medical decisions are based on diagnostic results. While the medical lab is fully digitized, preanalytics didn’t see much change in the last 40 years. It remains a black box – for labs, medical doctors and patients.
S4DX creates a data-driven preanalytical ecosystem. From sample ordering until sample arrival S4DX collects all relevant data-points to completely monitor sample workflow. Thus, we can reduce preanalytical errors in real-time and improve the preanalytical workflow and medical quality at the same time.
Our solution fits to all sample containers, all methods of transport and all IT systems. We do not change preanalytical steps – we improve them.
