					Environmental Data Spaces & AI
				
Data spaces provide accessible and interoperable data, ready to be at the heart of innovation.
For innovators, gathering and cleaning the data is a cumbersome and lengthy process. Pre-harmonised environmental data that complies with existing standards such as INSPIRE makes processes like training ML models faster and easier.
Data spaces also allow solution providers to sell their products across more countries thanks to the availability of large amounts of clean, reliable data.
For data owners, contributing to a data space turns their assets into high quality, high-value data sets. They retain full sovereignty to decide who can access which data when and to what purpose.
