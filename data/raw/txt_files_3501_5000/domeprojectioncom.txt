What solution are you looking for?
Simulation & Training
Are you a professional in the area of simulation – for example, driving simulation or flight simulation. Do you aim at a realistic simulation setup with narrow cockpits and night view situations? Do you need a high quality projection that is matching accurately to your projection surface and is warping to the eyepoint of the user? Then have a look at our ProjectionTools Sim Suite. We provide high quality projections aligned with accuracy up to 240Hz*. Also, have a look at Luna Warpbox, our new  low latency warp and image correction processor for 2d media and 3d simulation purposes. Warpbox LUNA is the perfect choice for multi projector systems displaying high level simulations and other interactive content.

ProjectionToolsfor Simulation, Training & Entertainment
The toolkit for your perfectly matching projections
Our software enables you to align an unlimited number of projectors projecting on any arbitrary screen or surface. ProjectionTools-generated calibration data result in a perfectly warped and blended projection combined with meticulously precise correction of color, black level and many more parameters.
Continuous development and integration of almost all eligible 3rd party AV hard- and software guarantees that domeprojection.com ProjectionTools are the most flexible industry-leading auto-alignment solution offering maximum quality for your display system.
Which suite is the right one for you?
Single-Cam AV
The Single-Cam AV package allows you a set-up of a multi channel single camera calibration with a final result of high accuracy and flexibility. A fast set-up and speedy recalibration makes it ideal for staging, rental and events.

Our Services
Camera and System Calibration
We offer you our time- and cost-efficient calibration service for highly complex multi-channel projections on arbitrary screens.
We are planning and implementing the auto-alignment system for your project as well as provide the complete installation and initial calibration. Finally, we will provide automatization of the complete system for easy operation by maintenance personnel.
In our professional calibration lab, cameras will be calibrated to be used for different distances.

ProjectionTools Training (on-site or remote)
In our ProjectionTools training, customers and integrators get prepared to work with our ProjectionTools. We offer individual training units, which are tailored to your needs and based on a modular concept.
Alone or in small groups, we will impart theoretical background know-how and practical skills to you. Sessions can take place on-site at your premise or at our office in Magdeburg. Alternatively we also offer remote training which can be carried out independent of time and place.
We will provide you with the necessary training materials and are also available to assist you after finishing training.
