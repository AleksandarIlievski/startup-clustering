NO¬†Installation
Zero maintenance cost
E-learning departments usually invest a lot of time and resources in the installation and maintenance of e-learning tools. What if teachers were able to create quizzes, share them with their students and get instant feedback on how they performed without ever installing anything? 
At HSPV NRW, a university in Germany, lecturers and students no longer need to deal with complicated e-learning software. Lecturers can simply create exercises and share them with their students via a link.
