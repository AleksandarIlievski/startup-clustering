Real-time object recognition in video recordings 
										People always strive to see more than what meets the eye. We record the entire world, integrate sensors into machines and collect data meticulously. Our drones fly over forests, cameras monitor entire airports and and inside our production facilities, every split second is filed. Data is generated ever faster while its evaluation gets more complex and repetitive. Engineers and data scientists spend their entire professional lives chasing after this data.  
										Our AI interprets data the very second it is gathered.

Wir Menschen wollen stets mehr sehen als wir eigentlich können. Wir filmen die ganze Welt, verbauen überall Sensoren und sammeln die Daten in endlosen Tabellen in der Hoffnung, dass wir sie irgendwann brauchen werden. Wir fliegen mit Drohnen um die Welt und filmen unsere Produktionsstätten von oben. Jeder Quadratmeter unserer Flughäfen ist überwacht, die Handykamera läuft ständig. Wir erzeugen Daten. Deutlich schneller, als wir sie verstehen können. 
							Was wäre also, wenn  nicht wir versuchen müssten, die Daten zu verstehen? Wenn Alogrithmen schon beim Filmen verstehen würden, was sie gerade sehen? 
							 
What do you want to see? 
							Our Artificial Intelligence finds exactly what you're looking for in recordings.

Let Artificial Intelligence work for you 
										Your top talents shouldn't be doing repetitive tasks. Algorithms reveal data structures much better and more efficiently. Use our technologies to automatize such processes and profit from our longstanding innovation leaders' expert knowledge. 
										
Bring transparency to your processes 
										Our Artificial Intelligence interprets data automatically and compares it to previously collected data. Simply put, we point out recurring processes and show you exactly where efficiency is lost. 
										
Work with modular systems  
										With our solutions, you yourself decice which systems and functions you require. We deliver first class technologies as building blocks that fit in seamlessly with your existing infrastructure. No Lockin and fully compatible.  
										
Automate the data transfer between different systems 
										Not only is our Artificial Intelligence able to interpret data within seconds — it also processes information in real time. You receive the results in the exact format you require.

			Robotics		
		Make the robot your right hand - without taking it by the hand	
In order for a robot to fulfill its job in production, specialized developers have to configure every single one of its movements. The robot is not aware of its surroundings and each change causes complications that the developers then have to remedy.
Contact us to learn how Synergeticon teaches robots to understand their environment and decide autonomously, so that your workers can collaborate with them and raise the productivity of your business.
