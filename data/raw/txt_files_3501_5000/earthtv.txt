Everything happens at the same time, at various places, in every time zone, from multiple perspectives, constantly changing.Here, the sun is rising – there, it is setting. Here, a music festival taking place – there a few friends meditate on a solitary beach. Here, a skyscraper is rising high – there, a new park is opened. Here people come together to celebrate – there, people stand together after a terrible disaster. Here the world is moving forward – there, the world is taking a turn backwards.Being there, live, while the world is changing around us, is pure inspiration. Around the clock we give interested people the opportunity to take part in any event of the world, and to be inspired by all the events that matter most to people.earthTV does not simply awaken my curiosity, it does not just surprise me time and again, earthTV keeps inspiring me with a unique way to connect the world live.
