Enable smart engineering with composites
Simutence is your highly specialized and independent partner for the virtual design of manufacturing processes and components with plastics, fiber-reinforced composites, and hybrids. Whether OEM, component manufacturer, process equipment provider, material supplier or engineering service provider – we are here to make your product and manufacturing process development cycles most efficient using advanced engineering and simulation methods.
Generate a digital twin of
manufacturing processes and products
Leverage from advanced engineering and simulation methods
Enable material and manufacturing efficiency
Benefit from our international
network and partners
Our approach to the efficient development of manufacturing processes and components is the seamless and close connection of product design, manufacturing validation, and engineering through our virtual process chain. Based on this, virtual manufacturing validation is enabled, which can significantly reduce real-world efforts on demonstrator manufacturing and manufacturing piloting.

Processing technologies
»We combine state-of-the-art and self-developed approaches for simulation and engineering to support you with product and process design for process technologies relevant to large- and medium-scale production.«
Seamless data stream
Our functional and modular virtual process chain is based on data transfer between the different simulation steps through mapping and homogenization approaches using our software add-on SimuChain.
Based on this, state variables such as fiber orientation or fiber volume content predicted by process simulation are retained and transferred to e.g. warpage or structural simulations.

Our approach
The idea of Simutence is to use existing simulation approaches where the state-of-the-art is sufficient and to use and develop simulation approaches, where the state-of-the-art is not sufficient.
We provide our customers with access to all of our simulation approaches through engineering services. Beyond that, we successively make these approaches available to our customers, as soon as a high-quality user experience is guaranteed.
What we strive for
As a spin-off company of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, we support and supply know-how and methods based on the latest state-of-the-art.
Our utmost interest is to enable you to gain maximum use from our know-how and collaboration with Simutence. Therefore, our services will be tailor-made to your specific challenge!
