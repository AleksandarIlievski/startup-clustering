We make digitalisation
There are many great tools, services and programmes which help you with writing invoices or with managing your bookkeeping automatically. But how to deal with the flood of incoming invoices arriving? We take care of that for you.We are not reinventing the wheel. We simply automatise operations that are onerous, that no one wants to do and that do not generate added value for your actual business. We rely on cooperations and offer interfaces in both directions. Imagine you could import incoming invoices directly into your bookkeeping software. This is, among many other great things, what we are working on every day.

“For our sales activities we rely on modern social media solutions, e-mail marketing and online advertisements. Every month, we have to deal with quite a number of receipts that we have to download individually. invoicefetcher® is a brilliant tool to automise this process for all of our providers’ portals. Now I do not have to think about collecting all receipts at the end of the month.I want to be able to focus on my main business. Every hour that I spend on paperwork means less turnover. The collecting of online invoices once a year charged by telecommunication companies, car rentals and hotels from e-mails and web portals used to be a recurring nightmare. Invoicefetcher manages all that fully automatically for me now. And now I am relaxed when I hand over my paperwork to my tax accountant because I can find everything in one place.Already during the foundation of my company I knew that it was important to simplify and automatise processes. invoicefetcher® is exactly what I have expected: set it up and relax! The service works fully automatically and saves a lot of time. I can find my receipts immediately. And all that for a reasonable price.
