What career event organizers say about us
We are really impressed by how Talentspace lets participants experience a similar buzz and energy as at in-person events. With its mix of interactive formats and clean design, the tool has enabled us to run virtual events that are incredibly high-touch and has allowed our students and partner companies to forge meaningful connections. The Talentspace team is dedicated to their platform – and to their customers! We have received excellent support at all times, making our online career fairs a great success.
Heike H.
Director of Career Center at WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management
We have been offering virtual events since March 2020, but were not satisfied with our existing online platforms. We onboarded Talentspace in September 2021 and have experienced outstanding results. The event platform allows us to provide a positive customer experience, increase brand awareness with the company and job info, and provides a variety of formats that fit our virtual event’s needs. Talentspace has been an outstanding partner and the team continues to listen to our needs and work together for improvements. One great example is the new hybrid option to offer both online and physical sessions in one event.
Chloe Jacobs
Program Manager at Amazon Operations
Talentspace is the most comprehensive platform for events, engagement and recruiting that we've used. Every aspect is simple to manage and the platform allows for configurations from 1:1s to full-blown Webinar-style events. And, it offers real-time interaction- no idle wasted time with students queuing up. It allows employers and students to engage both before and after an event as well as have meaningful engagement appointments during the event, too. It's the best platform we've used so far.
Emily N.
Associate Director of Employer Relations at Brown University
The feedback from the various business units as well as the participating students shows that the new virtual format and platform have been very well received. We were able to efficiently attract new interns through the virtual event. We plan to continue using the platform for future virtual events at Porsche SE.

Head of Employer Branding, Porsche
