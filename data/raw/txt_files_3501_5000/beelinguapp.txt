Acquire languages naturallyby reading and listening to audiobooks, news and songs.
We use the neuroscience of language acquisition, the simplest way to gain understanding and develop fluency. Using the parallel texts method, we unlock the brain's natural ability to learn languages in context.
Reading skills 
Our library features stories and news articles for learners at all levels as audiobooks. Because of our parallel texts methodology, learners can challenge themselves by reading more advanced stories.
Listening comprehension 
Many of our stories are narrated by native speakers to help learners fully immerse in their target language. Learners test their knowledge with quizzes at the end of stories.
Building vocabulary 
Learn new words with each story you read. We suggest key words for each story, and you can easily select words to add to your glossary. Practice and retain your new vocabulary words with flashcards and more.

                            Excellent tool for improving reading comprehension and building vocabulary.

                            Exactly as the pictures show. Interesting method in teaching bilingual readings. Wide variety of material without downplaying the virtual assistant directs us in the methodology adopted in teaching and reinforcing the chosen language. It's a good tool for both learning and for improving the language, based on reading (and phonetic) in parallel ... Thank you ! I think the course is excellent.

                        The app is useful for reading material such as current news and stories. Recently watching ads to get access to certain material has occurred but overall as long as it stays quality, free, and does what it's suppose to without becoming ad-city I am on board for a few more years!
