ABOUT ABALOS THERAPEUTICS
Harnessing the power of the arenavirus to fight cancer
 
novel anti-cancer approach
 
Abalos Therapeutics has harnessed the unique immune stimulation of the arenavirus to develop a novel anti-cancer approach that provides the full breadth of the immune system’s power specifically against cancer cells. Through viral replication within cancer cells, Abalos’ arenavirus-based drug candidates are designed to awake precise immune responses and activate all relevant immune cell types against primary tumors and metastases. Led by experienced biotech entrepreneurs and immunology pioneers, Abalos’ goal is to achieve a quantum leap in immuno-oncology.

ABOUT ABALOS THERAPEUTICS
Abalos Dunes on Mars
 
why abalos?
 
The name “Abalos” was chosen with regards to our arenavirus-based technology to fight cancer. The name of this virus family derives from the Latin “arena” for “sand” due to the grainy appearance of particles inside the virus when viewed in cross-section under the transmission electron microscope. Reflecting our “sandy” approach, we came upon the fascinating blue dunes of the Abalos region on the otherwise “red” Mars, a planet that has always held a special fascination.
Named after the roman war god and its association with fire, it provides a connection to harnessing the weapon of the arenavirus to launch an attack against cancer. As Mars is also known as a planet of sand storms, this can be associated with the strong immune-response that is triggered by the arenavirus to attack the tumor.

01
THE STRENGTH OF AREANVIRUSES AS THERAPEUTICS
Arenaviridae are a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that are genetically very diverse due to specific adaptations to their respective host.
LCMV is one of the best studied viral species belonging to the mammarenavirus sub-category. It has specific immune-stimulatory properties that make it an ideal candidate for a new treatment modality that induces a maximal immune response towards tumor cells, including distant metastases.

OUR SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION
Our scientific founders, immunology and virology experts Karl Lang and Philipp Lang, identified a specific set of mammarenaviruses that preferentially infect and proliferate in cancer cells, which results in a very strong and targeted immune response against the cancer. Abalos is translating these findings into a novel therapeutic strategy to enable a precise immune response and activate all relevant immune cell types against primary tumors and metastases.

MAMMARENAVIRUSES TO FIGHT CANCER
With our proprietary Fast Evolution Platform, we generate mammarenaviruses with optimized anti-tumoral properties that re-programme the patient’s immune system to eliminate the malignant tumor tissue.
