Why does the world need another learning (infrastructure) platform?
When Cyttraction founder Carolin started her first business in 2016 – a consulting firm helping SMEs and corporate teams with their digital transformation projects – she estimated that an external sparring partner would be key to accelerate the implementation of innovative technology. Years later, she recognized that not only sparring, but also motivated lifelong learning supports change. 
Searching for a SaaS solution that would work for cybersecurity or risk training, fit B2B needs and provide motivational interaction functions, she decided that it’s time to build this digital product on her own. Since 2020, Carolin and a team of around 30 freelance specialist work on inspirational learning content as well as the IT architecture of a secure learning infrastructure platform that provides one globally available user interface but also works with (changing) local data protection and cybersecurity regulations.
Cyttraction is completely bootstrapped. First revenue comes from the 3rd generation of cybersecurity basic courses (below) as well as keynotes and joint seminars.
