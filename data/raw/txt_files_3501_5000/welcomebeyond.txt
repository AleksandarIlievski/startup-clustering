Best Villa Companies 2020
November 2020
Wow is what you’ll utter when you step into any one of Welcome Beyond’s properties, available in dozens of countries from Mexico to Germany. Personal touches (you actually know who the owners are) and design feature heavily in their preened pads — from mirror-clad houses in the wilds of Italy to California farmhouses — and while they do cater for that top end of the spectrum, there are plenty of flash places to be had at real-people prices, too.
For design-minded iconoclasts
June 2018
Founders Oliver and Chris Laugsch, Berlin-based brothers, curated a collection of unusual houses (and small hotels) in 41 countries that they say favor personality over pretension. That might mean a rustic 19th-century barn in Tivoli, N.Y., with curtains for walls or a fully staffed Swahili beach house built by native artisans on Kenya’s Lamu Island.
So finden Sie Ihre Traumunterkunft
January 2017
Aus Berlin stammt das Konzept für Welcome Beyond. Oliver und Chris Laugsch sind mit ihrem Portal immer auf der Jagd nach ausgefallenen oder hippen Unterkünften für Individualisten – angefangen von hübschen Boutique-Hotels, Strandhäusern und Apartments bis zu ausgefallenen Schlafplätzen in einem Hausboot auf der Spree oder im Jurtenzelt in Patagonien.
Hey, how did you find this place?
May 2012
Recently, I logged onto VRBO.com, only to find my head spinning at the length of its roster. Scrolling through Hotels.com and Airbnb.com, I almost gave up.
Welcome Beyond offers lodgings with personality: a six-bedroom, cliffside villa in Phuket, Thailand, goes for 1,338 euros per night (chef included), and a cozy forest hut in Sweden with no electricity costs 44 euros. Welcome Beyond is best for the adventurous traveler who can appreciate the unusual.
Best Villa Rental Agencies 2015
July 2016
This rental company is the brainchild of two brothers from Berlin, and is a testament to their passion for architecture and design. They hand pick every property, currently available in 38 countries around the world.
The best travel websites ever
July 2011
For a property to make it on to this site it needs to be architecturally interesting and something of an interior design delight. Choose, say, between a cave in Sicily or a rooftop apartment in Buenos Aires. You can search by location or interest, whether that be culture, nature or simply staring at the (beautifully decorated) walls.
