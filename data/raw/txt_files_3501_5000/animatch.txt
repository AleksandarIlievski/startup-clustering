AniMatch is an online sharing-platform facilitating the exchange of organs and tissues of lab animals used for scientific purposes.
The number of animals used for scientific purposes keeps increasing. Despite many efforts to reduce the lab animal usage in accordance with the 3Râ€™s (Reduce, Replace, Refine) there is still a long way to go until research can be performed animal-free. AniMatch provides a simple, efficient way for researchers to make a change towards less animal usage.
