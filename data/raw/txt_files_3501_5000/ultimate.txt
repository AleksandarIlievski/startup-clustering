“Ultimate enables us to grant 24/7 support. Our support team is now able to concentrate on more complex topics. The biggest benefit is scalability. The bot instantly took 39% of all requests from the shoulders of our agents. That's the benefit of first-class onboarding.”
Martin F, Head of Customer Support, Mid-Market
"Our complex use case seems to work beyond expectations. I have experience with competitors' products and from my personal POV, it seems Ultimate's AI algorithm is a step ahead."
Atte K, Mid-Market
“Volumes of customer care requests are increasing and chat is an expensive channel to handle without any automation. Using Ultimate allowed us to scale up chat and make it a strategically important channel, when a significant share of chat requests can be automatically handled by the Ultimate chatbot.”
Jenni J, Technical Product Manager, Payment Fraud, Enterprise
"We were looking for a provider that integrates seamlessly with Zendesk and can do more than automate FAQs. Today we automate complex end-to-end conversations and processes, categorize tickets and help our agents navigate through their daily chats."
