„SOX is frequently used in research and teaching due to the increasingly important issues of safety and reliability.“
Simon Schoch, Hochschule Aalen – Technik und Wirtschaft
„We use BOM, FMEA, FTA, and FMEDA on SOX-Server. Due to this, a large number of FMEDA-variants can easily be created and maintained at different locations worldwide. Each FMEDA variant can be handled within maximum 10% of the time before using SOX. Time savings: 90%„
