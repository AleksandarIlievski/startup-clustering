Angiolutions is the first company 
to develop a device for small 
abdominal aortic aneurysm therapy. 
 
Philosophy 
The human cardiovascular system is permanently generating mechanical forces enabling its physiological hemodynamic function. Therefore, our heart and all blood vessels are continuously exposed to significant biomechanical stress.Adverse biomechanical forces significantly influence onset and progression of many cardiovascular diseases.At Angiolutions, we understand that sufficient biomechanical organ protection is key to the prevention and treatment of numerous cardiovascular diseases. Following this philosophy, we combine latest medical, biophysical, and molecular research with state-of-the art engineering to create novel mechano-protective devices and realize truly innovative treatment strategies for millions of cardiovascular patients in need. 
 
 
 
 
Focus 
Angiolutions develops the world‘s first device to prevent small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) progression and thereby revolutionizes the way AAA are treated today.AAAs are focal dilations of the abdominal aorta that may grow and eventually rupture fatally. That’s why AAAs sometimes are called ticking time bombs.While patients with large AAAs may receive prosthetic treatments to reduce the risk of imminent rupture, there presently is no therapy available for patients with small AAAs to prevent the life-threatening disease progression at a still relatively harmless stage.Based on latest research findings, Angiolutions is pioneering the development of a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device to prevent small AAAs progression, stop the ticking time bomb, and bring back peace of mind to thousands of patients.

A radically new understanding of AAA growth mechanisms our founders discovered at Stanford University 
What causes aneurysms to grow?
 
 
 
Pulse waves travelling down the aorta mechanically stress the AAA, driving AAA growth
 
 
 
Small AAA vulnerable to pulse waves due to stiffness gradient / mismatch with healthy aorta
 
Aortic pulse waves drive AAA growth
 
And how can we stop the growth?
 
 
 
Angiolutions device: nitinol-based, non-active class III implant 
 
 
 
Small AAA – protected from pulse waves – stops growing
 
Angiolutions device absorbs aortic pulse waves & stops AAA growth
