Navflex in action: Autonomous trailer (un)loading with natural navigation
Integrated Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) pallet jack and counterbalance forklift.
 
Picks up palletised goods and autonomously places and unloads trailers with millimetric precision.
 
Discovers and analyses the trailer on the fly, determines the optimum loading and unloading pattern, considers the load arrangement and places and removes loads comparable to human speeds.
Technology: 
Autonomous loading and unloading that works and drives like a humanWe are boosting the supply chain by creating affordable, plug and play mobile robots that autonomously load and unload trucks - powered by advanced AI robotics technology and load handling capabilities. Automation benefits on the (un)loading gateNavflex powered autonomous mobile robots (AMR) raise the efficiency of loading and unloading operations. Apart from  increased productivity driven by lower operative costs our customers also benefit from consistent and predictable workflows, improved handling with reduced product and facility damage, enhanced workplace safety and no more need to find workers for repetitive, unappealing jobsQuick ROI and flexible technologyPerfect, controlled environments and inflexible solutions - that's the stereotype of autonomous technology. Navflex powered robots work in natural, dynamic environments without any infrastructure modifications. Our flexible Plug and Play technology can easily integrate into any forklift platform to solve your unique challenges. With the reliability and manufacturing capabilities of OEM integration along with fast load and unload speeds, Navflex has an Industry Leading ROI of 12 months or less.Technology developed on the loading dockNavflex technology is developed on the loading dock and made for challenging tasks with unique load handling and placement capabilities. Advanced AI technology adapts to all trailer, container, and box truck sizes. Navflex quickly identifies space requirements and loading patterns, copes with different loads shapes and arrangements and places loads with millimetric precision. Navflex safely operates alongside people and other forklifts with an additional manual mode option for versatility.
