View Technology Overview  
NanoWiring is a galvanic process similar to pad printing. It is possible to produce the nanowires from practically all metals that can be galvanically deposited (copper, gold, silver, nickel, etc.). 
KlettSintering connects two substrates, only one of which has been prepared using NanoWiring. KlettSintering achieves significantly higher tensile and shear strengths than KlettWelding. 
In KlettWelding, two substrates prepared by NanoWiring are joined by pressing them together at room temperature. The obtained bond has superior electrical and thermal characteristics. 
KlettGlueing connects two substrates, only one surface has NanoWiring structure. Adhesive is applied before low pressure and low temperature compression. Suitable for sensitive devices.
