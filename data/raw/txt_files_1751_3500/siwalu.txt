AI-based Animal Recognition
Scan. Identify. Learn.
Learn more about your pet.
Pet owners frequently do not know the breed of their pet exactly. Therefore, our apps enable specific information about the various characteristics and traits of a pet.In contrast to a time and cost intensive analysis of the DNA, the apps provide a reliable statement about the breed within seconds. This implies not only pure breed dogs, cats or horses, but also the determination of mixed breeds.

 Love this app have found it to be at least 98% of time correct. I am an animal rescue and scan all my dogs, eventually I have DNA done and this app has been accurate. I am amazed 
Play Store review by Wendy Perry 
 Easy to use. I have 3 dogs and it correctly identified all 3 even though only 1 is pure bred and the other 2 have mixed parents. 
Play Store review by Ev C 
 I LOVE IT:This app is amazing!!! 
App Store review by _Bucket_Head 
 Perfectly accurate and user friendly. 
Play Store review by Sue Haupt 
 Wow! Totally accurate! Like sometimes people say our dog is an Australian shepherd and some say he is a border collie. It gave the percent and was totally spot on! It even turns people into dogs! XD 
Play Store review by Basilisk Brush 
 Easy to use and informative!:This app beats the others I tried and immediately deleted due to their uselessness! I love how you can upload 5 pics at once to get a more accurate identification! Every pic worked and it gave specific breed percentages with tons of information to help you confirm the breed, such as weight, size, personality, colors, patterns, eye shape, and even specific ear dimensions! By reading the main breed description, I was able to confirm many traits and feel fairly certain she is a Rat Terrier mix with a little Jack Russell Terrier. Even the sassy personality description sounds just like her! I was able to eliminate Toy Fox Terrier with the detailed size, weight, and coat information the app provided. Who knows how accurate the app really is, but I had fun and learned a lot! 80% dog breed match is good enough for me and beats paying $150 for a DNA test. 
App Store review by SillyJilly21 
 Insanely accurate:After years of believing my wolf dog was from a certain background. This app gave me so much information & opportunity for me to learn more about who my best friend truly is.

App Store review by Kittens 😍 
 This app has been phenomenal so far. It really helps and I have tested it with a few where I know the breed and it has done really well.
