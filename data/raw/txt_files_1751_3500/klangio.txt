Learn More                                 We are a start-up based in Karlsruhe that has set itself the goal of establishing artificial intelligence in the world of music, and thus enabling musicians worldwide to transcribe their favourite music pieces fully automatically.                    Artificial intelligence in music? That’s right! Because music doesn’t just move us humans. The AI registers the sounds and converts them fully automatically into sheet music. Played, Heard, Printed.                                              What is the underlying magic? We use a deep learning method for audio processing. This means that we have taught our AI to process notes by using millions of examples from music. Therefore, our AI doesn’t just register sounds, but is able to understand the musical structure. Clever, isn’t it?                  What professionals are saying             "Until now, my handwritten notation of compositions and arrangements was the fastest and most secure. I was then completely surprised how Piano2Notes can playfully analyze a complex composition and effortlessly transform it into a piano score. It recognizes melodies, rhythms, and harmonies at a high level."  Till SahmPianist and producer (Silbermond, Rea Garvey, Sarah Connor)Picture: Amelie Siegmund             "Piano2Notes has already saved me a lot of time and effort because it works excellently. I especially like the export function. It allows me to further edit notes generated by Piano2Notes myself."  Prof. Florian SitzmannKeyboardist of the band Söhne Mannheims and lecturer at the Popakademie Baden-WürttembergPicture: Jörg Steinmetz             "Piano2Notes has saved me a lot of time when composing. If I want to write something every now and then, and I don't have any note paper with me, I can quickly and easily record it with the app, get a first image and then conveniently edit it further. A good idea and a quite reliable realization!"  Han-Lin YunPianistPicture: Anna Tena             "I like to work with Piano2Notes, because it takes up the job of transcribing a piece that I have recorded into music notes and setting the changes. It is a tremendous time-saver and therefore has become my highly valued co-worker."
