CookieDurationDescription_ga2 yearsThis cookie is used by google analytics to distinguish users._ga_2 yearsThis cookie is used by google analytics to persist session state._hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress30 minutesThis cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user. This is a True/False flag set by the cookie._hjCachedUserAttributessessionThis cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample. Collected attributes will only be saved to Hotjar servers if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool, but the cookie will be used regardless of whether a Feedback tool is present._hjClosedSurveyInvites365 daysHotjar cookie that is set once a user interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal. It is used to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown._hjDonePolls365 daysHotjar cookie that is set once a user completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in._hjFirstSeensessionThis is set to identify a new user’s first session. It stores a true/false value, indicating whether this was the first time Hotjar saw this user. It is used by Recording filters to identify new user sessions._hjid365 daysHotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID._hjIncludedInPageviewSample30 minutesThis cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your site's pageview limit._hjIncludedInSessionSample30 minutesThis cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your site's daily session limit._hjLocalStorageTestunder 100msThis cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage. If it can, a value of 1 is set in this cookie. The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost immediately after it is created._hjMinimizedPolls365 daysHotjar cookie that is set once a user minimizes an On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the widget stays minimized when the user navigates through your site._hjRecordingEnabledsessionThis is added when a Recording starts and is read when the recording module is initialized to see if the user is already in a recording in a particular session._hjRecordingLastActivitysessionThis should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies). This gets updated when a user recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the user performs an action that Hotjar records)._hjSession{site_id}30 minutesA cookie that holds the current session data. This ensues that subsequent requests within the session window will be attributed to the same Hotjar session._hjSessionRejectedsessionIf present, this cookie will be set to '1' for the duration of a user's session, if Hotjar rejected the session from connecting to our WebSocket due to server overload. This cookie is only applied in extremely rare situations to prevent severe performance issues._hjSessionResumedsessionA cookie that is set when a session/recording is reconnected to Hotjar servers after a break in connection._hjSessionTooLargesessionCauses Hotjar to stop collecting data if a session becomes too large. This is determined automatically by a signal from the WebSocket server if the session size exceeds the limit._hjSessionUser{site_id}365 daysHotjar cookie that is set when a user first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID._hjShownFeedbackMessage365 daysHotjar cookie that is set when a user minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback. This is done so that the Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the user navigates to another page where it is set to show._hjTLDTestsessionWhen the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed._hjUserAttributesHashsessionUser Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated._hjViewportIdsessionThis stores information about the user viewport such as size and dimensions.
