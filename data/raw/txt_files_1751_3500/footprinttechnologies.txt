Three steps to shoes that fit 
Instead of using inaccurate sizing tables, Footprint offers a seamless foot-measuring user experience that works across all Android and iOS smartphones.
Without installing an app.   
1. 
Click the Footprint icon 
Easy to find on your product page, users simply click the Footprint plug-in. Co-branded and harmonized with your shop design. 
 
 
2. 
Capture your feet 
An intuitive step-by-step process guides users through photographing their or their child’s feet using only their smartphone camera and a single piece of A4/ US-Letter paper.  No app download is required.   
3. 
Find the perfect size 
We match your customer’s foot size measurements against your individual brand- and model-specific shoe database, finding them the perfect fit. User profiles can be created and personal measurements can be saved for future purchases. 
 
Match your shoes to your customers’ feet - all before they make the purchase 
With a simple click of our webshop plug-in, Footprint allows your customers to scan their own feet at home using their smartphone’s camera. We then match their precise foot measurements with your brand- and model-specific shoe size database, finding them the perfect fit.
