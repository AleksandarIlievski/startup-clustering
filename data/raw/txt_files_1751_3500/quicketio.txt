The foundation of the solution is based on the years of acquired seat maps data (from paid and public sources) and amenities across hundreds of commercial airlines. It is verified by the industry leaders like Airbus, OAG, Kiwi, Kayak, etc. Cabin AmenitiesWe provide amenities like seat's Pitch (legroom), Width, and Recline, as well as WIFI, In-Flight Entertainment, and Power. This provides vital information so the passenger can make an important decision about seat comfort and purchase upgrades when necessary.  Bags allowances Our Baggage allowance information incorporates the Point-Of-Sale rule led by IATA. In other words, if a US-based airline shows some rules on their website in the US, this will not be applied for searches in the EU. Food and drinksEmbedded into search results Food and Beverage information gives potential passengers' well-informed nutrition decisions before the final booking.CO2 ImpactQuicket calculates a relevant CO2 score based on a flight distance, plane type, average load factor per route (city pair), and by computing Breguet engine coefficient for the fuel consumption. We embrace the IATA methodology as we think it has better environmental integrity.Ability to switch between Volume-based and flat pricing model plus payment automation allow Quicket to maintain very competitive pricing within the industry.Please see our DEMO website for data and seat maps samples.Monthlyfrom$399Yearlyfrom$3990Contact usImmersive rich media (panoramas)Interactive media have a 30-50% higher rate of conversion.

Our target is to create minimum interruption with maximum visibility for additional services. Photo-realistic panoramas are optimized to be used for web and mobile.Click to SeeCabin PanoramasDue to the costs associated with producing the panoramas, Quicket is now licensing them  to the Airlines, Railways, and Plane manufacturers (rapid prototyping).
