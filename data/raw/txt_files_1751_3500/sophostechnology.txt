ソフォス導入事例を確認
 
        “「Sophos MDRは、ソフォス製品以外の他社製セキュリティ製品などを導入・運用する拠点についても、数多くのベンダーのセキュリティテレメトリを取り込んで運用可能であるため、既存のセキュリティ資産を無駄にせず活用できることも採用の決め手の一つとなりました。」　株式会社荏原製作所さま”
                      
        “「Sophos MDRセキュリティサービスの採用により、私自身もセキュリティ対応の業務から開放され、企画IT部門としての本業である新たな企画やシステム開発など、生産的な業 務に注力できるようになりました。」 ゼオライト株式会社さま”
