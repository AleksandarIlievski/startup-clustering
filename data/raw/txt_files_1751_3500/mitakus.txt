Food Waste  not only reduces profits, It’s a critical environmental challenge                          The dilemma with food waste      More than one third of all food produced globally is wasted every year. Food waste is a far-reaching problem with huge financial, ethical, and environmental costs.Restaurants and commercial food service providers have few effective tools to prevent inefficiencies around ordering and waste. Until now.                                            The Ideal Use for AI      Fresh food is a complex product due to its perishable nature, supply chain logistics, and diners’ evolving needs and preferences.Mitakus uses Artificial Intelligence combined with large amounts of historical ordering and consumption data to help decision makers optimize fresh food and ingredient ordering and utilization.                  Mitakus Creates a Better Food Future      We help restaurant, commercial food service providers, and suppliers optimize menu planning, while saving time, resources, and money.Not to mention that less food waste results in more efficient land, water and resource use and management. All of which has a positive impact on climate change and environmental impact.Let’s do something for our future.
