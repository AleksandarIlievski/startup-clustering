MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGINGNVision Imaging is leveraging advances in quantum physics to enable the first routine, convenient and affordable use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for assessing early patient response to cancer treatment at the metabolic level.ꜜOne of the key issues in today's cancer therapyTHERE ARE MORE THERAPY OPTIONS THAN TIME TO TRY THEM.MISSION / VALUEMETABOLIC MRI PROVIDES UNPRECEDENTED INSIGHTS AT CELLULAR LEVEL.vsStandard MRIDetects slow-changing effects at tissue level.Metabolic MRIDetects early changes of key metabolic pathways at cellular level.NVISION'S INSIGHTS AT CELLULAR LEVEL ALLOW EARLIEST ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSE TO CANCER THERAPY.vsChanges at tissue level:
​
Typically, changes are visible only months after onset of treatment.Changes at cellular level:
​
Effective treatment induces metabolic response in tumor cells within days, visible with Metabolic MRI.METABOLIC MRI FOR ADAPTIVE CANCER TREATMENTDifferentiation between resistant and sensitive tumors within days by means of Metabolic MRI: Patients who are found to have resistant tumors can shift to a combination therapy or alternate drug, whereas patients who are found to have sensitive tumors can confidently continue with the sametreatment - but with certainty.~ 7 days

Hyperpolarized metabolites are safe to use routinely, and do not require exposure to ionizing radiation.THE HYPERPOLARIZED METABOLITE IS NOW VISIBLE TO THE MRI AND READY FOR INJECTION.ONCE INJECTED, THE ENHANCED METABOLITE IS DISTRIBUTED TO THE ENTIRE BODY.Including to the target region, such as a brain tumor.THE HYPERPOLARIZED METABOLITE, E.G., PYRUVATE, IS TAKEN IN BY THE TUMOR CELLS.Inside the cell it is metabolized to its downstream products.THE MRI SCANNER CREATES A METABOLIC HEAT MAP.METABOLIC MRI MAKES NATURAL METABOLITES VISIBLENVision is applying advances in quantum sensing to enable routine, convenient and accurate quantification of cellular metabolic activities.NVISION'S ADD-ON POLARIZER STRENGTHENS THE SIGNAL OF NATURAL METABOLITES BY 100,000 TIMESThis is achieved by a process called hyperpolarization, carried out by NVision’s polarizer on the metabolite before injection.
