Why controlling?
 
A good financial controlling ensures that entrepreneurs and responsible decision-makers in the involved departments have the best possible knowledge base before taking any decision.A good financial controlling identifies challenges and undesirable developments over time. The analysis then allows the entrepreneur or decision-makers to take the needed adjustments. Optimally, in this case, it’s ensured that the company can act sovereignly even in difficult times.Specifically, a good financial controlling detects deviations, which can be identified, for example, through plan-actual comparisons or the setting up of an early-warning system inside the company.Subsequently, the responsible department makes a diagnosis that clarifies whether measures have been correct and why results may have been different than originally planned.At the end of this process stands not least the introduction of previously developed corrective measures to counteract possible undesirable developments and avoid conceivable future problems from the outset.All this is provided by good financial controlling!
