CUSTOMER & PARTNER VOICES 
 
 
“The application of eyewear is often underestimated in terms of quality and surface. After many years of working together, we really trust in DyeMansion technology to ensure quality and scaling in our manufacturing process.” 
Sebastian Zenetti, Managing Director & Head of Sales at YOU MAWO  
 
 
“In our partnership DyeMansion has made a significant contribution to open up the entire consumer goods sector by enabling the coloring of parts. For a long time, that wasn’t possible.” 
Marie Langer, CEO at EOS 
 
 
“We produce thousands of powder bed fusion parts per month, and our current DyeMansion equipment has become invaluable to processing components efficiently.” 
Greg Reynolds, Vice President of Operations at Stratasys Direct Manufacturing  
 
 
“Together with DyeMansion, we’re giving our customers a comprehensive, proven additive manufacturing process tailored to our H350 3D printer. This enables our customers to easily move from powder to consistent, quality finished parts at scale. The alliance will help accelerate the adoption of SAF technology for end-use parts production.” 
Pat Carey, Senior Vice Presidet Americas Products & Solutions at Stratasys 
 
 
“The Powershot C system allows us to reduce processing times in blasting by up to 80%. The homogeneous surface finish it provides is also much more consistent than parts blasted by hand.” 
Frederick Wray, Operations Manager at Digital Manufacturing Centre  
 
 
“We can now produce spare parts at scale using on-demand 3D-printing and finishing processes that meet our technical specifications and surface quality standards.” 
Ralf Anderhofstadt, Manager Center of Competence 3D-Printing at Daimler Buses   
 
 
“The Powershot Performance Series marks the next milestone in the strategic partnership between DyeMansion and Siemens towards industrialized Additive Manufacturing.” 
Karsten Heuser, VP Additive Manufacturing at Siemens Digital Industries
