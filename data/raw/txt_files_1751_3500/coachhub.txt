6 good reasons
		Why digital coaching?
		
Conventional seminars and  workshops are not enough
According to McKinsey, 75% of all employees consider the training offered them as ineffective. Often this is due to the ‘seminar effect’ – employees may leave a seminar feeling well-informed and motivated, but the positive effects decrease as employees find themselves back to carrying out their day-to-day routines. Even worse, there is no training offered.
Employees are forced to learn their roles “on the job” and without professional support. Studies have shown that sustainable learning and behavioral change require a shift in culture. Implementing a coaching culture – one that is scalable, measurable and flexible – helps generate a much needed cultural and behavioral change. CoachHub is the solution.
Digital doesn’t mean impersonal
Digital doesn’t mean impersonal. CoachHub connects coachees to their coaches and augments and enhances sessions with micro-learning tasks. These features help enable the transfer of practical experience and integration
of the content into everyday working life. This approach to learning is scientifically proven to be 3x more effective than conventional seminars and workshops.
External coaching for the C-Suite is the norm
But why shouldn’t it be for everyone? Most learning and development professionals agree, coaching works. It enhances teams and the company’s bottom line. If that’s the win-win situation, then why are companies
reluctant to implement digital coaching? Organizations might book a digital coach occasionally to little effect. What’s needed is a systematic approach. Enter CoachHub.
Superiors are not coaches
There are exceptions, but generally a superior isn’t able to manage and coach a team at the same time. Given the growing workloads and time constraints on managers, coaching team members isn’t seen as a priority. Many employees don’t feel
comfortable speaking openly and honestly with their bosses about professional development challenges. CoachHub coaches individuals and our digital coaching platform guarantees total professionalism and confidentiality.
Retention and engagement
Coaching has a direct and indirect effect on the commitment of employees. First and foremost, this is achieved by increasing job satisfaction and at the same time, by the leadership qualities of superiors. Coaching a single executive can improve the motivation
and cooperation of the entire team, to the extent that an employee is committed to the company’s objectives. They also positively influence the behavior of their colleagues and improves their interactions with customers.
CoachHub is the cost-efficient solution
ROI of coaching is higher than more traditional and conventional learning and development techniques. Why? 85% of information gained during seminars or workshops is forgotten
within 14 days. In other words, 85% of the costs associated with conventional L&D are not properly invested.
