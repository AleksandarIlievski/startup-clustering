Welcome to SUSTIFY 
eLearning courses for human rights, including occupational health and safety, presented in simple language. Gamified with a focus on the essentials.Responding to the requirements of the supply chain law, from your own factory to the direct suppliers in the Global South. Versions for different industries, cultures and of course in the national language. Audio included for users with reading difficulties. 
 
Use our gamified e-learning courses for OHS and worker engagement to increase social compliance at your suppliers! 
							Increase social compliance from your own processing plant and throughout your supply chain with our eLearning approach – individual, interactive, and inclusive!
Sustify is a new form of eLearning solution specifically designed for production workers. We currently offer courses on fire safety, occupational health and safety (OHS) and human rights. We develop additional courses as required. The content is based on the typical non-compliance issues in production facilities and takes into account the requirements of social standards and legal regulations. We do not aspire to impart detailed academic knowledge, but to create awareness for those topics that are truly relevant in everyday work (micro-learning).
The knowledge and awareness acquired in this way also forms the basis for effective grievance management. Only when employees are aware of their rights and obligations in the workplace can they decide whether they should make an official complaint or whether problems can be resolved in other ways. Opt for a gamified eLearning approach that meets the relevant legal and ESG requirements in your own company and across global supply chains.

						Thanks to Sustify, we have implemented an innovative training method that helps us raise awareness of human rights and anti-discrimination issues in a fun and effective way at our manufacturing sites around the world.					
Carolin Würtele & Renata FuschiniManager Sustainability & Manager HR 
						„Sustify has created a tool that enables topics relating to social and environmental protection in the supply chain to be addressed and learned in an appealing and interactive manner and at the same time gives workers a voice. Both we and the employees in our supplying factory in China are enthusiastic.“					
Julian Offermann & Katharina BrunsDirector procurement & Director Impact 
						„Sustify’s digital capacity building approach gives workers a voice, empowerment and the opportunity to learn something for themselves. For us, this is exactly the right way to get to know people and create transparency and fairness for our entire supply chain. We are happy to be on this journey together with Sustify. Working with Sonja is not only uncomplicated and professional, but always exciting and fun.“					
Nicole HartmannCR Manager Social Compliance 
						"Despite and also because of the COVID19 problem, we have trained 1056 workers in 9 factories in China individually and digitally with the microlearning course "Occupational health & hygiene". We found a competent partner for this in Sustify. Not only the capacity building approach convinced us, but also the reliable and smooth project management of Sustify in the factories on site."					
Jacqueline Thalmann CSR – Teamlead Social Compliance  
						„In order to get even more transparency in our global supply chains within the framework of the Supply Chain Act, especially with regard to compliance and social standards, we consider Sustify's eLearning courses for workers to be a very innovative and reliable solution to achieve exactly this goal."

How can Sustify make your procurement more responsible? 
A risk analysis in the supply chain is the basis for selecting the suppliers for which capacity building makes sense as an approach which goes beyond auditing. Verifiable training of the entire workforce - and not just management or specialist staff - can be carried out as part of corrective action plans (CAPs) or as a preventive measure. This collaborative approach with suppliers creates strategic partnerships and increases resilience.
Transform your purchasing practices from tactical and reactive compliance efforts to strategic, proactive steps toward responsible sourcing. Opt for full transparency, new concepts in supplier selection and integration, fewer audits and more targeted interventions and collaboration - e.g. through digital training.
