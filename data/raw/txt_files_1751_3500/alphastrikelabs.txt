Cyber Situation ReportVulnerable CITRIX Server
When the CVE-2019-19781 – Vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP appliance was published, we conducted three Internet-Scans.
The side-by-side comparison of the two heatmaps shows how the data we generate can be used for cyber situation reports. We used recurrent scans to visualize the development of the number of vulnerable servers for the CITRIX vulnerability published in December 2019. The heatmaps illustrate the difference in scans from Jan. 11th, 2020 to Jan. 21st 2020 and the associated positive trend nicely. For example the scan results have been shared with the German BSI – Nationales IT-Lagezentrum und Meldestelle.
  
  
Case Study
Epidemic? The Attack Surface of German Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic
We analyzed the attack surface of German hospitals and healthcare providers in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the study were presented at the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 13th International Conference on Cyber Conflict in May 2021.
The study shows that 32 percent of the services analyzed were vulnerable to varying degrees, and 36 percent of all hospitals examined had points of attack.
