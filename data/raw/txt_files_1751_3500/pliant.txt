Regarding physical cards, customers can choose between Blue (Visa Platinum Business) and Black (Visa Infinite Business credit cards). Pliant is neither a prepaid nor a debit card and, therefore, is bank account independent, offers maximum card acceptance, and does not need to be charged in advance.What are virtual cards?Virtual cards work the same way as physical cards, only that no plastic version of the card is provided, with card data being only accessible via your Pliant app. Advantages of virtual cards include their instant availability. They also cannot be lost and are offered with a range of flexible usability options. Since they are offered at no extra cost, separate virtual cards can be issued for specific merchants or purchases with individual settings tailored to the specific use case. That way, if something is wrong with one card, there is no need to update card data across multiple merchants.Find out moreWe’re here for you.Our team is available every Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm to answer your questions personally.
