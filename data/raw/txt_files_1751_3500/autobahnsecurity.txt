“Vulnerability scanners detect issues, but they don’t address root causes. We made a cyber security platform, that quickly turns scan results into actionable remediation guides.”
 
At Autobahn Security, we take the issues found by vulnerability scanners, and through eliminating irrelevant findings and aggregating and grouping relevant ones, we turn them into prioritized actionable Workouts, designed to arm you for the most important process: tackling the root causes.
