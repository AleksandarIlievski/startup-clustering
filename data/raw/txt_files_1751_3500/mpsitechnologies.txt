Technical Overview
Above diagram shows the run-time situation of a project developed using both Whiznium tools.
WhizniumSBE
●  Powerful multi-threaded IIoT solutions with HTTPS, DDS and OPC UA.
●  Numerous applications in industrial automation and robotics.
●  Reference projects and code examples for well-known ARM- and Atom-based systems.
●  Fine-grained modelling of all aspects from database to web-based HMI and API library.
●  Compile-readiness and very clean structure of the generated code.
●  Simple intermixing of generated code and manual additions.
	
WhizniumDBE
●  Development for powerful FPGA-based / SoC hardware.
●  System specific command set with implementations as RTL on one hand, and as host system library on the other hand.
●  Analogous code generation for 8-bit MCU’s.
	
Key Advantages
●  Slash embedded software development time by up to 70% *)
●  All time-consuming development tasks which may not be the core features of your high-tech product – Whiznium handles them for you.
●  Whiznium knows Embedded: it injects expert knowledge on FPGA’s, databases, secure communications and more into your project.
●  And what’s best: all code is in plain sight for your developer team – no closed source libraries are required.
●  Your gain is sustained: Whiznium ensures well-structured and clean source code trees for feature-rich applications.
*) based on the FabSight example: 17 person-days of modeling and implementation for FPGA, Embedded and Cloud components. 349000 lines of code of which 4970 are hand-coded to implement the core functionality. Not a single line of manual code for database, communication, API library, …

Success Story
At the request of a customer, we put both Whiznium tools to work and got a cool IIoT project off the ground in record time, from FPGA-based data acquisition to cloud back-end! The FabSight project illustrates nicely why turning to Whiznium for a complex embedded software project instantly pays off…
