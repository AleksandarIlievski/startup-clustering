We make our member talent’s scouting efforts hassle-free. Tell us what you need and we provide you with the most suitable options for your individual requests.
Identifying new employees and co-operations
What skill-set will fulfil or complement your company's needs? Describe your requirements and we will provide suggestions for a suitable person, a great team or even a potential source for co-operations.
I can quit screening or filing employment ads?
Exactly! Those days are over. SKILLARY will display your skills (as talent) as well as stored search profiles (for companies) respectively.
What data do I need to create a meaningful profile?
Creating a talent or company profile is quick and easy. All you need is the most important personal data. In order to make the profiles meaningful and increase the chances of a "match", a lot of additional data, skills, work samples, photos from the companies, etc. can be stored depending on the type of profile. If you should not have all important information at hand when creating the profile, all data can also be updated or supplemented later.
