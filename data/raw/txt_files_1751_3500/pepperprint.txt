These profiles are characterized by unique antibody binding sites on protein targets, known as epitopes. Using PEPperPRINT's unique laser printing technology, entire protein targets can be translated into highly overlapping peptide libraries in a convenient microarray format, allowing for both in-depth and high-throughput screening of immunogenic epitopes.
