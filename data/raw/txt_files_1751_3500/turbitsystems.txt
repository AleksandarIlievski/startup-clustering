Power AI Monitoring 
Performance RisksToday's wind turbines are getting bigger and generate six-figure revenue losses per incident quickly. Unnoticed underperformances create substantial losses. ​
​
Read more and understand performance risks...Maintenance RisksToday technical failures still occure unplanned. Repair measures of main components lead to weeks of downtime.
What’s more: failures sometimes aren’t diagnosed and repaired correctly, resulting in multiple service events, downtimes, and difficult decision-making processes. These risks are not covered by Full Service Agreements.
