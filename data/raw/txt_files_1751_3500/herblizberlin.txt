Questions & Answers ➤ between Myth & Truth #CBDknowledge
Could CBD and hemp be an option for me?
	If you are looking for more balance and well-being in your hectic everyday life then CBD- or hemp products could be the right thing for you. Small feel-good moments with CBD oil, bath additives and cosmetics can lead to deep relaxation during stressful times. In our categories SLEEP, FOCUS, RELAX and BEAUTY you will find the right product for the right moments for you.
Why are we not offering PayPal for our CBD & hemp products? 
	 Because the laws regarding CBD products are internationally still not unified some international companies such as PayPal are still careful in terms of enabling sellers in those markets which is why PayPal is currently not clearing CBD shops. 
	 As soon as transactions in relation to CBD products are detected by PayPal it will freeze the seller's account as well as the assets in that account. In our HERBLIZ online shop, you can currently pay with several other methods such as KLARNA, advance payment or credit card. ;
Why were hemp and CBD illegal?
	 Under German law plants and parts of plants (and products produced by them) belonging to the cannabis, category are generally listed and restricted under narcotics. This is because a cannabis plant does not only contain CBD but also the in Germany still illegal THC which can lead to a change in consciousness and “highs”.
	 But because hemp has been used for centuries in the industry and CBD does have no psychoactive effects or serious side effects the European court legalized it in 2016 under certain guidelines. Since then, hemp and CBD products are legal if they fulfill the following criteria: 
	They originate from cultivation in a country belonging to the European union with certified seeds (hemp) or the THC level of the plant is below 0,2% 
		 The trafficking of them is exclusively scientific or commercial which excludes the chance to be used for intoxication.
	
Where to purchase good CBD?
	 When buying CBD products, it is important to check if only EU-certified, high-quality hemp plants have been used. Ideally, all products are from bio-cultivation and therefore free of “herbicides”, “pesticides” and artificial fertilizer. Here at HERBLIZ we only use CBD extract from conscious and sustainable sources from GMP-certified bio-farming. Furthermore, all ingredients of our products are tested for purity in an independent lab. The certificates for this you can find in all the product descriptions.
What exactly is CBD actually?
	 CBD is the abbreviation for cannabidiol which is one of the more than 104 active components (cannabinoids)  of the cannabis plant. So CBD is a 100% natural plant product that occurs amongst others in legal hemp.
	 The amount of the illegal cannabinoid THC in legal hemp has to be below the legal limit of 0,2% in any industrial hemp. In marihuana plants, the THC level is significantly higher though which means that in Germany they can only be cultivated by licensed companies for medical purposes. #whatisCBD

CBD & Hemp products of the highest quality 
Quality is what counts! Quality plays a very important role when talking about CBD and hemp oil. This is why we are confident to give you a quality pledge: But what is it that makes our CBD products so great? Let us explain it to you:
						
We test independently! After our CBD and hemp products are finished in our production they are being sent to an independent lab to be tested for pureness and quality. Only after they have passed all the tests our creations are approved for sale. This is how we can ensure to provide you with a clean and tested product of the highest quality which can also be felt in the aroma and effect.
						
Transparency is important to us! At HERBLIZ and our products, you can find the lab certificates in the product descriptions and get familiar with all the ingredients of our products. Because the EU law restricts the THC level to 0,1% all our products are of course entirely legal
						
The ingredients are key! Because we only use top quality ingredients our HERBLIZ hemp cosmetics line is awarded the cosmos-bio-seal. Our CBD oils contain exclusively basic oils of high quality and are all pure BIO-quality. #HERBLIZqualitypromise

I am pretty new to CBD and was looking for something that helps me relax in the evenings. The customer support was super friendly and helpful.

I have always loved to take a long bath from time to time. I normally use bath bombs, but I've never found any that I really like. But since I discovered HERBLIZ and started using their Lemongrass Massage Oil, my whole body is soft and I'm more than relaxed when I get out. I love it!

I stopped smoking one year ago and Vaping CBD was definitely part of my way to do so. Another nice side effect of vaping is that it helps me focus a lot at work. Since I’m a developer it’s an essential skill to have.

There's nothing better than having a long, relaxing bath after an exhausting day of physical activity. I have tried a lot of different products, but HERBLIZ bath salts are my absolute favorite because they consist of 'real' natural ingredients like himalayan rock salt, essential oils, rose leaves and nurture the skin perfectly. It feels like becoming one with nature! I absolutely love them!

Good ingredients are of great importance to me and my skin shows for it. I especially enjoy the Face Serum from the Hemp Cosmetics line. In order for me to keep my cool during my work, I favor taking the Olive Fresh Mouthspray, which is mild and still fresh in taste.
