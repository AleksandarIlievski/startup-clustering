Our customers
Fast and smooth processing, everything is fine!
I couldn't imagine a better service provider and partner. Standards are really set very high here.
I recommend Clevvermail services because they can be set up quickly, are reliable and everything can be controlled from the computer.
Fast processing- very discreet- very good service
The possibility of setting up postal addresses abroad has been very well implemented by clevver and at prices that are affordable for small businesses. The customer service responds quickly and friendly to incoming requests. Highly recommended!
Setup and verification was quick and they answer tickets quickly. I have packages on the way to the mailbox so will be able to do a better review later.
Difficulties in communicating via online chat but unparalleled responsiveness from the sales manager who took charge of our file. He provided clear and precise answers to all our questions until he provided us with the solution best suited to our needs.
Two Thumbs UP!!!!!
I signed up to the wrong plan and needed to resolve the issue. My account manager Natalia was incredibly helpful in explaining options and clarifying what I needed to do. Her communication was direct and responsive. Great customer service, thank you.
Solid service. A little on the pricey side but I have been a customer for a few years and I am satisfied. It fulfills all my mailing needs.
made setting up an address in the uk much easier, helpful account manager and customer service
I use mailbox service for both Australia and the United States. I am satisfied with the service I received for both locations. Customer support was excellent, especially in my last purchase. They helped me solve my problem with superhuman patience. Thank you so much.
Polite, quick to respond, competent and services at a good price
Initially made a mistake as I was setting up an account for a client, however, the Clevver.io support team was extremely helpful in processing a refund. It has now been done correctly and my client is very happy with the services they provide.
SIMPLY THE BEST TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN EUROPE
