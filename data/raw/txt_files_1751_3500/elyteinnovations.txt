Electrolytes for Batteries  
Service and Measurements  
What are electrolytes?
            Electrolytes are the blood of every battery system!        
The lifetime, power, safety and charging time of a battery is in addition to the choice of anode and cathode material, strongly determined by the composition of the electrolyte solution. The electrolyte consists of a solvent or solvent mixtures, one or more conducting salts and contains various performance additives targeting specific purposes. The ability to conduct ions, in particular Li+-ions is the main function of the electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries. Further, the choice of the electrolyte is even essential for the graphitic anode to work at all. Decomposition products of the electrolyte forms the so-called solid-electrolyte interphase SEI at the graphite interface, that prevents ongoing electrolyte reduction and partial exfoliation of the graphite structure. This interphase is also critical for effective ion exchange and the lifetime of the battery.
                                            more to know                                        
Why tailor-made electrolytes are needed!
            There is no universal electrolyte for every battery system!        
 
Batteries are needed in a wide variety of applications – each has its own area of use and therefore individual requirements, e.g. low- / high-temperature applications, high charging / discharging rates or increased safety among others. The standard electrolytes used so far do not meet these demands! Holding on to this electrolyte leads to compromises in performance, application area or cost structure. E-Lyte Innovations applies a fast and sophisticated electrolyte development process to create tailor-made electrolytes for each of the specific objectives. These compromises can be avoided where one cannot and will not afford them.
                                        more to know                                    
Where are costumized electrolytes needed?
            There are almost countless applications for batteries…         
 
…including the e-car industry, the aerospace industry, the classic customer devices such as mobile phones, laptops and tablets, but also medical technology where, for example, pacemakers with high-performance batteries are used. Due to the diverse fields of application and their special features, the demands on the battery are also almost unlimited. Electric cars should be able to travel as far as possible on one battery charge, both in the deepest wintertime and in the hottest summer. Batteries in satellites must be able to withstand the conditions of space – the less you have to insulate the battery for this purpose, the more cost-efficiently and correspondingly longer with regard to cycle life and shelf life they can be used. Mobile phones and laptops have to power increasingly complex computing processes – but of course, the battery life should not have to suffer. These examples are only the tip of the iceberg as batteries are included in countless applications.
