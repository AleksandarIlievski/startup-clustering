          Enfin des écouteurs stylés qui prennent soin de nos oreilles J’avais commandé ma paire de NOVA H1 lors de leur campagne sur Kickstarter.
Les boucles d’oreilles sont vraiment stylées. Le chargeur un peu moins mais ce n’est pas gênant. Il est compact et pratique.
Je peux enfin écouter ma musique ou être en vidéo conférence avec mes boucles sans avoir peur des otites! En utilisant mes AirPods de façon intensive , j’ai eu des otites du conduit auditif à répétition. 
Merci Nova!     A. G.   02/16/2023      NOVA H1 Audio Earrings Silver         Excelent birthday gift I purchased this lovely golden pair of audio earrings as a birthday gift for my wife.
As a tech person myself, I found this product very interesting. Audio earrings with directional sound. The sound was better than I expected but of course not comparable to a Sennheiser headset.
More importantly, my wife loved the birthday gift. In the beginning, she thought she only got a pair of earrings. When I explained the product to her, she was totally surprised that something like this is possible. 
She wears them often and I only notice that she is listening to music if the room is very quiet, otherwise I don´t hear any music and that is, in my opinion, an amazing piece of technology. 
The gift box and charger look fashionable and luxurious.
All in all, a great birthday gift.     Daniel S.   02/13/2023      NOVA H1 Audio Earrings Gold         I love it! love it! love it! So, my Nova H1 audio earrings finally arrived and they look great! 
The order was neatly packed in a branded box made of paper, which pleasantly surprised me... it's nice of Nova to think of environment! 
I find it easy and intuitive to handle Nova audio earrings. Actually, that was my boyfriend who discovered this new gadget first, he is a big fan of hi-tech novelties. And he knows that I listen to music all the time. Once I was so into my music that I lost track of what's going on around (because my headphones blocked the street sounds) and I was almost run over by a car :/ But with my new Nova audio earrings I can safely listen to music when I want..     Irina N.   02/13/2023      NOVA H1 Audio Earrings Silver         A beautiful alternative to classic earbuds I use my NOVA H1 clip-on to listen to music and podcast in the metro, on the street and on my bicycle. I have to say that I really appreciate to have my ear canal free - feeling much safer, especially when biking! 
The earrings do not fall off my earlobes but also do not hurt. 
I can only recommend.     Marie P.   02/10/2023      NOVA H1 Audio Earrings Gold         Absolute recommend Alright, so I got these through Kickstarter. I've got two lobe earrings on each side, which is why I bought the studs as I thought there'd be less of a risk losing them. Unfortunately, they just didn't fit my ears and they hurt like a MF, I simply couldn't wear them (and for this price, that's a bummer). I contacted NOVA and received the BEST customer support. I was able to ship my earrings back so they could remove the stud (shipping costs were on me). They kept me updated, and I received my earrings back within a week - and mind you, this is including international shipping. Now I've basically got clip-ons, and they're wonderful. A while ago at work I was listening to an audiobook during a dead moment, and no one knew! I wear them when I go shopping, and I finally don't miss all my incoming calls anymore because I'm connected and I get an incoming ring (my phone's been on silent since like 2007). 
All in all, I definitely recommend this. I'm sure it's not the best audio quality you can get, but you'll look far more fashionable wearing these than wearing over ear JBL's all day. They're pricey, but the quality of the product and the customer service is top notch.
I have yet to try them during a family reunion, but I trust they'll help me through any insufferable meeting.     E.V.   02/10/2023      NOVA H1 Audio Earrings Gold
