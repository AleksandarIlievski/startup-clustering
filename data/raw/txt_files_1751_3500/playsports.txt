SPORT MUST ADAPT TO US 
"It is difficult to pursue one's favourite sport in a busy everyday life. Organising it yourself is too time-consuming, playing in a club is too inflexible. With PLAYSPORTS, we write our own rules: We play where, when and with whom we want. Without limits, obligations or compromises. Because what counts is the desire for the match." - The PLAYSPORTS founders
