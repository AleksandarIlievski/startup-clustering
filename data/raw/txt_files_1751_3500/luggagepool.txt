Best service received
Delivery partner was very friendly and flexible. He was hard working and made sure that all assemblies are done correctly. I would recommend all to use Moovick for relocation service.

Moovick offers a very high standard of professional service
They completely hand hold you through out the process. Its like almost being with you in person. I was coordinated for my case by "Misha" and the communication was crisp and clear. Strongly recommend.

I had a very comfortable and good experience
The customised delivery support was very prompt over WhatsApp (communication in English which was super helpful). I was able to arrange a very last minute delivery of something I found on Ebay (for a sunday morning). The driver was also very helpful and went the extra mile helping with things that weren't necessarily a part of the service. Highly recommended to try this!

Excellent experience
I sent the WhatsApp  well after 'after hours' and Misha from Moovick support was extremely efficient and helpful. This was a last minute booking from our side as our confirmed moovers had to cancel and i was so pleasantly surprised that within minutes Misha had confirmed that Olek would be available! Olek you guys were amazing thank you so much for being efficient and so friendly! Will definitely recommend and use this service next time.

Excellent support provided
They helped us decide the appropriate size of the transport vehicle based on the number of items. The transport vehicle was very good and also the driver was very helpful. A 10 out of 10 for everything. I would definitely recommend the service.

The driver and helpers were very professional and quick in the entire process
The decisions for splitting and loading between two vehicles were made on the go and the assembly service was also good. Thanks to moovick for being in constant communication for support. Highly recommend the service.

The only reasons I am giving 5 stars
All in all, I have had a very smooth experience with LP support team, and would absolutely recommend the platform to anyone; ESPECIALLY, if you are new to the city, don’t speak German and need support in English, or are on a budget with moving within the city. The price is very reasonable for the service offered, of course this might be quite dynamic considering your package, but we ultimately pay for the service and trust, I believe!

I highly recommend this service for a reasonable price
Great customer support through WhatsApp even on holidays. Moovick helped me move from Munich to Hamburg very easily. The driver was very professional and punctual. To be honest, this is the best customer service I have experienced in Germany. 💯
