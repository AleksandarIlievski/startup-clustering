Our Business thrives
					Movinx is a digital insurance technology company specializing in customer experience.			
We are centrally available, yet tailored to individual mobility partners. We use driving and vehicle data to strengthen insurance offerings from local carriers, resulting in a purpose-built, individualized and scalable ecosystem. 
We enable a global auto insurance strategy while speaking the local market language, with a modern, fully-digital solution that will unlock the future of how customers interact with their end-to-end services – protecting them as they get from A to B, however they choose to do it.
