ALPHA CLEANTEC AG
GREEN AND RAPID SOLUTIONS AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
q
OUR TEAM
Experts have in-depth knowledge and experience in the fields of environmental solutions, petroleum geology, chemistry and engineering.
VISION
Deliver a better planet to our children by providing technologies for a sustainable future. Provide safe, green, rapid, efficient and cost effective technologies to resolve environmental harms and hazards caused by inadequate human and industrial activities and thereby becoming a leader in the field of soil, wastewater and railway ballast remediation
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES
New type of in-situ chemical oxidation processes that have been developed in collaboration with well-known experts and specialists and the support of the Casali Institute of Applied Chemistry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel which is one of the leading centers on the research in the field of applied chemistry and related industries. Alpha Cleantec technologies can efficiently treat a wide range of soil and water contaminants from petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents, to cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries leftovers and by-products. The contaminants can be treated by Alpha Cleantec products and processes with concentration of up to 100,000 ppm and meet local regulation levels at the end of the process. The intellectual property of the company has been patented in national phase. Independent tests carried out with TÜV Süd have proven the efficiencies of the technologies, whilst harmless to the environment.
