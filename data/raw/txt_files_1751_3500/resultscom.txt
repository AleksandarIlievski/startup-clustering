Our mission is to bring transparency to the B2B software market. 
As we live through a golden era of software, we're spoiled for choice. Yet, with so many options available, finding the right software for your business can be exhausting and time-consuming. Smart consumers turn to reviews for advice - but no two businesses are the same, and most reviews are actually opinions.
Rather than relying on opinions, our team of experts focus on the hard facts and features to help you find the right software for your business. Software can make or break modern businesses, so making the right choice is more important than ever.
In short: we do the work and cut through the noise, so that you don’t have to.Popular Software CategoriesCommunication & CollaborationProject Management SoftwareProject PlanningDiscussionTask ManagementLatest ReviewsBigCommerce ReviewShopify ReviewWebflow ReviewWix ReviewSquarespace ReviewRecently AddedPayment Processing SoftwareCRM featuresCustomer Service SoftwareOrder Management SoftwareInventory Management SoftwareThe Problem With Most Software ReviewsReviews are a great way to learn about different types of software and is now one of the main ways that smart consumers do their research. Now, more than 80% of purchases are informed by online reviews, with more than two-thirds of readers believing that the reviews are accurate and reliable.
The problem? They're usually not. 
Of about a quarter of all product reviews online, research shows that the majority of their reviews are unreliable - that is, paid, fake or inaccurately written. Many companies have large budgets specifically focused on buying or influencing reviews. This is especially true when it comes to online casino software. 
Choosing the right software is important, and yet, this leads to people making important decisions based on inaccurate information.
