What is DISQVER?
Conventional diagnostic methods based on blood cultures usually require from two days to several weeks to identify a limited set of pathogens. Noscendo’s DISQVER platform identifies more than 16,000 microbes including 1,500 described pathogens (bacteria, DNA viruses, fungi and parasites) within 24 hours.
The cell-free DNA in the patient’s blood is determined using next-generation sequencing (NGS), a new, exceptionally fast method for DNA analysis. DISQVER’s bioinformatics algorithms compare this information against Noscendo clinical grade genome reference database. A report detailing all relevant pathogens detected in the sample is provided within a few hours. This knowledge can be used for blood stream infections and sepsis, in oncological diagnostics or diagnostics for endocarditis, for example.

ADVANTAGES OF DISQVERAT A GLANCE
P
Cell-free DNA as new and more abundant biomarker allows precise analysis of the microbial load at the time of blood collection
P
Detects bacteria, fungi, DNA viruses and parasites from a standard blood sample using next-generation sequencing
P
Reliably identifies difficult and non-cultivatable pathogens
P
Independent of an already started anti-infective therapy
P
Without prior cultivation or prior knowledge of the possible cause of infection
P
Reliable statement on the exclusion of an infection
How DISQVER works
About noscendo
Noscendo is the leading global provider of software-based pathogen identification technology. We’ve made it our objective to revolutionise infection diagnostics, thus saving patient lives. To do so, we combine the latest molecular biology methods, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), with proprietary bio IT solutions in our analysis platform DISQVER. Scores of well-known university hospitals, major regional hospitals and hospital groups are already using DISQVER. We also work with health insurance providers such as TK and IKK Südwest.

pressENDigiSep trial achieves next milestone: Over 200 sepsis patients now included Mar 24, 2023 About a year ago, the recruitment phase of the trial "DigiSep - Optimization of sepsis therapy based on patient-specific digital precision diagnostics" started. Now the project, led by the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine at the University Hospital Essen, has reached another important
milestone: since mid-March 2023, half of the planned 410 trial patients have been recruited. Only in February, 43 patients were added, so that the recruitment target can be reached as planned in summer 2023.
