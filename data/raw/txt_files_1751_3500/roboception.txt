Eyes and Brains for Your Robot
Roboception offers innovative 3D vision hardware and software solutions that enable any robotic system to reliably perceive its environment in real-time.
OUR STEREO SENSORS & OUR SOFTWARE SUITE
RC_VISARD
RC_REASON
 Intuitive and flexible, Roboception’s perception solutions
reliably close the perception-action-loop.
Sense. Reason. Act.
The end-to-end Applied AI solutions go “from pixel to action”, enabling any robotic system to perceive and assess its environment, and to plan and execute actions, e.g. pick-and-place objects.
rc_visard
The rc_visard sensor family enables robots to generate and process time and location-related data in real time.

rc_viscore
The rc_viscore is the world’s first 3D stereo sensor for robotic applications, featuring 12 MP resolution.
