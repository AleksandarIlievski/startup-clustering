What we do
With metaphactory you fast-track your Knowledge Graph journey and drive enterprise-wide knowledge democratization.Empower end users to experience & consume data in contextmetaphactory abstracts from the underlying complexity of a Knowledge Graph and allows you and your users to consume data intuitively and in context and connect the dots between individual pieces of information.Improve data literacy through meaningful and actionable insightsA Knowledge Graph provides a machine-understandable view of your data; metaphactory makes that view human-understandable through intuitive exploration, search and visualization interfaces that deliver actionable insights.Collaborate across user groups & capture hidden expert knowledgeWith metaphactory, business users, domain experts, application engineers and knowledge graph engineers can contribute to the semantic model, transforming data into reusable and company-wide available knowledge.Build Knowledge Graph apps that allow you to adapt as you gometaphactory accelerates your time-to-market for new digital services and products by allowing you to start with a targeted business case, iterate often and extend the use case, semantic model and data sources on the fly.Learn moreGo from idea to production in just a few weekswith an agile, iterative process
Together with your business users and domain experts, we review your current processes, discuss your solution goals and current pain points, and define your users' information needs. 
Knowledge graph engineers and domain experts use metaphactory's visual ontology and vocabulary editor to collaboratively define a knowledge model that reflects your domain-specific concepts, relations and the end-user information needs identified in the previous step. The knowledge model is validated with business users in an iterative manner.
Data stewards leverage metaphactory's data cataloging and data governance features to maintain and curate heterogeneous data sources and map data to the domain knowledge model. 
Application engineers use metaphactory's low-code approach to translate end-user information needs into intuitive, model-driven interfaces and quickly build apps for search, visualization, discovery, exploration, and authoring. Business users and domain experts are onboarded early to validate the user experience and interaction patterns. 
Business users and domain experts access the application to consume data, quickly find relevant information, and gain meaningful and actionable insights for their daily tasks.
