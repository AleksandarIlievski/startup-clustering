A new molecular understanding of biology
DEOXY allows drug developers to understand a compound’s mode of action. fully. 
DEOXY performs fully automated, multiplexed, targeted single-cell profiling, and correlates gene expression levels with protein detection, thus creating unprecedented insights into complex biological processes.
By quantifying RNA delivery to different cell types on the single-molecule level, we help you optimize your delivery vehicles for mRNA therapeutics and CRISPR systems. Correlating the delivery efficiency with multiplexed protein and gene expression in the individual target cells allows us to simultaneously measure the efficacy and toxicity of the cargo.
