Is my data protected? 
                        The security of your data is of great importance to us. Your connection to GradeView is secured with 128-bit encryption, your data is saved encrypted and is generally anonymous.                    
Am I really anonymous? 
                        Apart from your email address, which is required for resetting your password and for notifications, no other personal information will be collected. Companies also won't have access to your data and are only able to view it anonymously. They have the option of contacting students internally - for the purpose of informing them of an internship that matches their profile for example. This option is only available within the portal and they will not be able to access your email address.
