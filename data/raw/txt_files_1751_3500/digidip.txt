About Us
We don't make promises. We deliver.
And honestly, there is nothing more to add to that. Since 2013 we aren't trying to impress with the usual marketing buzzwords to show how strong our technology and service behind it is, we rather proved it by always going the extra mile, being authentic and drive real results.
On a mission to simplify the complexity of Commerce Advertising we started as a bootstrapped company, continued on a rocky road to profitability to now being a valuable partner in the industry for so many exciting brands and publishers. Since 2021 we have been a part of the YK Group, an association of companies in the Commerce Advertising sector. In 2022 mrge, backed by Waterland, a private equity investment group, is launched and suceeds the YK Group. mrge is now the leading global platform for Commerce Advertising, connecting more than 5,500 publishers, 50,000 advertisers, 100 networks in 160+ countries and generating an annual e-commerce revenue of over $ 2.0B .
