How does it work
The Direct Debit Process
1
User fills in bank details either IBAN and if applicable BIC or well known account number and bank sorting code (only for first time checkout). We validate and score the request.
2
User signs a mandate by clicking a checkbox . Users with a high risk profile have to enter a code received per email or mobile phone.
3
From now on you can debit the user’s account by just sending a request through the API.
