See the magic with just two simple commands:$pip install zenml$zenml goQuickstart Integrate your StackThere is no one-size-fits-all MLOps tooling stack. ZenML decouples the pipeline from the stack with simple abstractions. Configure and share your stacks using the CLI and seamlessly switch between local development and full-on production stacks. The entire data science and machine learning team can share these stacks. These stacks will supercharge your steps and pipelines with extra functionality .Learn moreHOW IT WORKSOrchestrate AnywhereSay goodbye to vendor and tool lock-in. ZenML runs out-of-the-box with many powerful orchestrators like Kubeflow and Airflow.

If the wrong decisions are made while creating your technology stack early on, it leads to complexity and technical debt as you progress through the stages of MLOps maturity. ZenML allows you to define your ML workflows in a vendor- and tool- agnostic manner, so that you can write your code knowing that you can switch out ML components easily as and when it is needed. Read more our our blog.Still not clear?Send us a messageQ: How does ZenML compare to orchestrators (Airflow, Kubeflow, Flyte, etc.)?At a high level, an orchestrator in MLOps is a tool that enables developers to schedule, monitor, and manage workflows. ZenML is not an orchestrator, but rather is a tool that lets you author pipelines that can be run on multiple orchestration systems. There are standard orchestrators that ZenML supports out-of-the-box, but you are encouraged to write your own orchestrator in order to gain more control as to exactly how your pipelines are executed. ZenML not only allows you to easily swap our orchestrators, but also then focuses on adding value within the pipeline itself, with features such as model deployment, metadata tracking, and management of the configuration of your MLOps stack.Still not clear?Send us a messageHow can I quickly deploy the infrastructure required to run ZenML?There are two sides to this question. ZenML itself can be deployed as a service, which centrally tracks everything related to pipelines and stacks. However, ZenML also often requires additional infrastructure for various stacks. The ZenML MLOps Stack repository contains Terraform scripts to quickly get you started with these stacks. These recipes can also be called directly with ZenML with zenml stack recipe deploy . Read more here.Still not clear?Send us a messageQ: How can I be sure you'll stick around as a tool?The team behind ZenML have a shared vision of making MLOps simple and accessible to accelerate problem solving in the world. We recently raised our seed round to fulfill this vision, and you can be sure we're here to stay! Plus, ZenML is and always will be an open-source effort, which lowers the risk of it just going away any time soon.Still not clear?Send us a messageQ: Can I use tool X? How does tool Y integrate with ZenML?Take a look at our examples directory on the GitHub, which showcases detailed examples for each integration that ZenML supports out-of-the-box. The ZenML team and community is constantly working to include more tools and integrations to the above list (check out the roadmap for more details).
