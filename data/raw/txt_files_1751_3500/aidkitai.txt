Driving Safe AI for Everyone
Validating perception to get your ADAS/ADS on the road
Safe perception for an autonomous world
The Al-powered perception component needed today in order to compete tomorrow must handle numerous scenes and conditions combining in a way that defies full specification.We have built the fastest route to it with aidkit.

AIDKIT
Your route to safety validation for AI perception functions
Specify
Define your development strategy based on an Operational Design Domain that makes the world manageable, then define the scenes you need to master so your AI can manage that world
Test
Leverage augmented data to challenge your perception component, develop new scenarios for testing, and ensure robust handling of new situations all while respecting data fidelity
Improve
Learn where your perception model falls short and precisely what scenarios you need to add and what data you need for retraining and retesting until all unreasonable risk is removed
A safe perception package
Get your AI ready for the world with aidkit
One integrated tool
Harmonize traditional safety management and the disruptive Al world
Bring together your perception software development and system development through safety validation designed to meet the challenging world of ML, the demanding data requirements of perception, and the need for understandable safety arguments

All your testing needs
Maintain perception component performance in all common and edge cases of your ODD
Conduct testing to confirm performance within your ODD catalogue and discover new safe and unsafe areas so you can expand the scenes your perception component can handle while pushing the boundaries of your ODD

Efficient data management
Ensure data fidelity for sufficient and appropriate testing of all safety relevant scenarios
Make sure you have the right data to conduct the right tests needed to push your performance while still efficiently managing and tracking that data so you can prove your work and provide evidence for your results and safety claims

Designed for ADAS/AD perception testing
A custom solution for your unique needs
Our aidkit software was built with the same goal as you: safe deployment of perception components in automated vehicles. aidkit testing functionalities are designed around the ODD that you specify and that defines your requirements.aidkit ensures you meet the common and edge-cases in that ODD then helps you push further to discover new safe and unsafe areas by combing existent ODD attributes. This way we don’t just get your AI on the road; we ensure your AI gets everyone back home safely.
