Happy customers
HVA (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences) – Read case study.
Our research group conducts a lot of interviews. Previously, we worked with our own pool of transcribers.
I’m glad that now our interviews are all transcribed in one place, it saves a lot of time in arranging everything.
L. Van den Berg – Lecturer-researcher at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam 
Grundl Institute – Read case study
Amberscript offers their service cheaper than the competitors, thanks to a largely automated process. Besides, the customer service is great. Usually, everything runs so smoothly that I don’t even notice anything during the whole process.
Jochen Hummel – Executive at the Grundl Institute 
Company Webcast – Read case study
In cooperation with Company Webcast, the leading webcasting provider in the Netherlands, Amberscript developed a speech recognition which is specifically trained on political language. Google’s recognition simply wasn’t accurate enough for political terms, names of political parties, or legislations, which are frequently discussed in our clients’ meetings.
