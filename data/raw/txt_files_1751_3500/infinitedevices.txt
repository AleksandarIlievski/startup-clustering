infinimesh IoT Platform
infinimesh is a opinionated multi-tenant hyperscale Internet of Things platform to connect IoT devices fast and securely with minimal TCO. It features a unique Graph-based authorization system, allowing users & engineers to create arbitrary hierarchical ontologies, with the possibility to scope permissions down to single sub-devices to specific users (e.g. suppliers). It exposes simple to consume RESTful & gRPC APIs with both high-level (e.g. device shadow) and low-level (sending messages) concepts. The infinimesh IoT platform is open source and fully kubernetes compliant. No vendor lock-in - run it yourself on Kubernetes in your own datacenter, under your control with maximum data privacy.
Our API's (REST / gRPC) are considered als beta and may change in future. infinimesh has already available:
MQTT support for version 3 and 5
State management (digital twin)
Graph-based permission management (multi-dimensional permissons at data layer)
TLS 1.2 / 1.3 support
Device-to-Cloud and Cloud-to-Device messages
Enhanced UI
k8s and Docker environments

CLI
Usage
Start with inf help and inf help login ;)
Homebrew
See macOS.
Snap
Just run
snap install inf
and see usage usage
Linux
.deb (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
Go to CLI Releases
Get .deb package for your CPU arch (arm64 or x86_64)
dpkg -i path/to/.deb
If you're using some other arch, let us know, we'll add it to the build. Meanwhile - try building from source
Then see usage usage
.rpm (RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, etc.)
Go to CLI Releases
Get .rpm package for your CPU arch (arm64 or x86_64)
yum localinstall path/to/.rpm or dnf install path/to/.rpm
If you're using some other arch, let us know, we'll add it to the build. Meanwhile - try building from source
Then see usage usage
AUR (Arch Linux, Manjaro, etc.)
If you have yaourt or yay package must be found automatically by label inf-bin
Otherwise,
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/inf-bin
cd inf-bin
makepkg -i
Then see usage usage
Others
If you're using other package manager or have none, you can download prebuilt binary in .tar.gz archive for arm64 or x86_64, unpack it and put inf binary to /usr/bin or your $PATH/bin.
If you're using some other arch, let us know, we'll add it to the build. Meanwhile - try building from source
Then see usage usage
macOS
If you're using Homebrew:
brew tap infinimesh/inf
brew install inf
You're good to go!
Then see usage usage
If you don't have Homebrew, consider using it ;), otherwise you can get prebuilt binary from CLI Releases page as an .tar.gz archive.
# if you have wget then
wget https://github/infinimesh/inf/releases/#version/inf-version-darwin-arch.tar.gz
# if you don't, just download it
tar -xvzf #inf-version-darwin-arch.tar.gz
# move binary to /usr/local/bin or alike
mv #inf-version-darwin-arch/inf /usr/local/bin
You're good to go!
Then see usage usage
Windows
Go to CLI Releases
Get prebuilt binary from CLI Releases page as an .zip archive.
Unpack it
Put it somewhere in $PATH
Then see usage usage
Build From Source
See CLI repo for source and instructions.
Development
Local development installation
We have built an automated local development setup based on Docker.
Add this entries to /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 api.infinimesh.local 
127.0.0.1 console.infinimesh.local
127.0.0.1 traefik.infinimesh.local
127.0.0.1 rbmq.infinimesh.local
127.0.0.1 db.infinimesh.local
127.0.0.1 media.infinimesh.local
127.0.0.1 mqtt.infinimesh.local
Clone this repo via git clone https://github.com/infinimesh/infinimesh.git
cd into the fresh cloned repo
Run docker compose up
Swagger API: https://infinimesh.github.io/infinimesh/
Generating proto files
Clone proto repo
Navigate to cloned repo directory and run:
docker run -it \
  -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/infinimesh/proto \
  ghcr.io/infinimesh/proto/buf:latest
Right now we keep protos generated only for Go. If you need one of the other languages, add according module to buf.gen.yaml.
PRs are as always welcome.
Local Development
Start the local dev environment via docker compose up -d.
Login locally via CLI:
inf login api.infinimesh.local infinimesh infinimesh --insecure
