USP—Our advantagesWe enable your employees to independently integrate artificial intelligence and neural networks into your company. Alternatively, we offer you our full service and implement your individual AI solution in your company.
EfficiencyIt is part of the natural biorhythm of humans that they get tired after a while and have to recharge their resources. Machines, on the other hand, can work on their tasks around the clock.
PrecisionCompared to humans, machines are able to work much more precisely. This is due to the fact that they have completely different fine motor skills. In addition, they can perform a variety of repetitive tasks with the highest accuracy, reducing the margin of error to a minimum.
SafetyYour know-how and your data belong to you. Without cloud and external dependencies. True to the motto “trust is good, control is better”, we make sure it stays that way with our AI solution.
ProfitImplementing and hiring artificial intelligence saves huge costs. Algorithms are cheaper than labor and thus reduce personnel costs in your company.
WHAT is actually—AI TrainingYour know-how and your data belong to you. Without cloud and external dependencies. True to the motto “trust is good, control is better”, we make sure it stays that way with our AI solution.

FAQ—Frequently asked questions
What is artificial intelligence (AI)?AI is the abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence, which is also referred to as Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thus, machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence. The technology is commonly used to support and or automate human decision making processes and groups them in this umbrella term.AIUI’s software uses the power of artificial intelligence, for example, to analyze and evaluate numerical data, images or text, or to make predictions.
What is a neural network?By means of a training algorithm, artificial neurons can be “shaped” in such a way that they understand the underlying data and their background and can perform tasks with the “knowledge”.A neuron is thus nothing more than a function that establishes a connection between data (input) and what is behind it (output).
Who or what is AI-UI?AIUI stands for Artificial Intelligence User Interface. It is software with which one can create a special kind of artificial intelligence (neural networks) via a purely graphical user interface.AIUI combines the implementation of state-of-the-art AI technologies in Python with current web technologies based on JavaScript for the user interface. The software follows a graphical programming approach, in whichrecurring processes in the creation, training and evaluation of neural networks are packaged into reusable units.These can then be placed, adjusted and connected to complex arrangements via drag & drop. The advantage over an implementation based on program code lies both in the preservation of clarity and in the possibility of quickly recombining, testing and analyzing the arrangement.
Where is the difference from Chat GPT ?Chat GPT is designed to provide answers to a wide range of users. Training is done with general data and is based on a large knowledge base to provide answers to a wide range of general questions.AIMS, on the other hand, is created and trained for specific use cases. This allows specific solutions to be created for customer-specific requirements.
