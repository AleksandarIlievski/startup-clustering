ABOUT US 
What We Do 
HighLine Technology develops and commercializes highly efficient dispensing technology to benefit future relevant production industries with  resource saving innovation. In close collaboration with Fraunhofer ISE and access to the PV-TEC Laboratory, our main focus is to reduce material consumption in the PV-industry and thus further increase its competitiveness and sustainability. However, we also develop dispensing solutions for further production industries. Our engineers cover the whole package from construction, integration to process application.

ABOUT US 
 
History 
Established in the year 2019 as spin-off from Fraunhofer ISE in Freiburg, HighLine Technology GmbH aims on commercialization of the parallel dispensing technology.
Dispensing for Si-solar cell metallization was started at the institute in 2010. The later founders of HighLine scaled up the dispensing print head and developed substantial know-how on printing pastes and production processes. As the potential of the dispensing technology for the metallization of Si-solar cells became immanent, the team applied for EXIST-Forschungstransfer of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and pushed the technology towards industrial maturity. In course of the funding program and in cooperation with our investors, HighLine Technology was founded in order to develop and commercialize high-tech dispensing solutions for different production industries. 
ABOUT US 
Our Vision 
HighLine Technology is a collaborative space for dedicated engineers with the aim to develop production solutions for future relevant industries like photovoltaics. Our innovations shall support the path towards more efficient and sustainable production industries within a world supplied by renewable energies.
