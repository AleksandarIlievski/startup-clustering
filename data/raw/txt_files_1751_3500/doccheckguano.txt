Birds of a feather flock together? Not our style! We promote healthcare startups who believe in their vision and want to be a success at it. DocCheck Guano is a hatchery for precocial birds aiming to land in the market.
We provide the ideal fertiliser for startups: capital, know-how, market access and network. Oh, and our focus is on seed funding.
Help your business grow Guano is the right breeding ground for startups to help their business grow. The ingredients are by no means secret. It’s these fertilisers that make your business most effective:
Capital
ParticipationSeed financingFuture investmentStrategic investments
Know-how
Corporate managementHealthcare expertiseBusiness skills
Market access
Direct access to communityDirect access to servicesDiverse channels of communication
Network
Founders among themselvesInvestorsStartup events
OutcomeIt’s the result that counts: Providing capital is not enough for us. Or you, for that matter. Other than quickly digested financial means, our Seed Financing Model focuses on market access and sustainable strategies. After all, what use is it if you’re forced to quit the market after a short while? And we’ll give you healthcare and business management know-how on top as well. So in the long run, Guano will become a fruitful startup network where all projects financed by us can enrich each other.
Guano is not a typical investor.
Guano is a networker and a partner.
They’ve already done it This is where we’ve already done some fertilizing –
and now we’re ploughing away to harvest the crops when they’re ready.

Praise is a recommendation
"We’re pleased to have found a partner in DocCheck, a leading community of medical experts in Europe. Together, we can promote the setting up of medical experts teams much faster and better and thus help even more patients."
Dr. med. Donata von Dellingshausen, Founder of BetterDoc
"DocCheck has hatched a completely crazy idea and is way ahead of the market. But we believed in this project – and successfully so! And now we want to support similar ideas, too: technophile, maybe even slightly nerdy healthcare startups."
Dr. Frank Antwerpes, CEO DocCheck AG
