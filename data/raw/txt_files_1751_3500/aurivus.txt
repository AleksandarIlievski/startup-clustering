How aurivus AI Works 
 
1. Upload your point cloud to our AI 
2. The AI finds the objects and their attributes 
3. Use the pre-modeled point cloud 
The AI needs only a few minutes to analyze the scan data. The result is a pre-modeled point cloud with objects and layers just like in a CAD-model.Let our AI assist you to make modeling easier, faster and cheaper.

Pipes 
Our aurivus AI can easily detect pipes & their fittings. Allowing the point cloud user to view as a single object (With our Speed Drawing Mode you can save up to 50% of your time modeling pipes). 
Trusses 
Our aurivus AI can easily cross section and focus on Trusses you need to model. Saving you lots of time with 1 click. 
 
 
Stairways 
Our aurivus AI can detect any & all stairways in your point cloud. 
Furniture 
No need for cleaning up your point cloud anymore! The aurivus AI detects furniture and other distracting objects in the point cloud, which then simply can be hidden with one click. 
 
 
						Walls (Wall Placer Tool)					
The aurivus AI easily detects Walls, so you can confirm the object with 1 click. Helping you save time, reducing errors & increase quality. 
 
						Window & Doors (Window & Door Placer)					
The aurivus AI easily detects the Windows & Doors within the point cloud. The Windows & Door Placer tool, will then replace them with a matching object from your Revit library. 
 
						Floors (Automatic Level Placer)					
The aurivus AI detects the floors within the point cloud, and the Level Placer tool will automatically set the levels. 
 
						Objects					
The aurivus AI detects objects, allowing you to freely move or hide with one click. 
 
						2D Modelling					
With 1 click you can see 2D view of your building. 
 
						Roofs					
The aurivus AI will detect a roof within your point cloud, allowing you to hide the roof from the 360 view. 
 
						Speed Drawing					
The aurivus Speed Drawing Mode automatically adjusts the views in every of the four perspectives to let you focus on modeling e.g. pipes or beams, instead of losing time finding the right view to continue work with.

How we help 
Scan-To-BIM AI 
Our aurivus AI finds objects in 3D laser scans of buildings, facilities, and plants. It’s trained for architecture, structure, MEP and industrial pipes. 
 
Less costs and higher profitLess costs for manual work, recruitment, hardware and higher productivity 
 
10x Faster LearningLess learning time to work with point clouds and higher motivation for modelers 
 
No training requiredaurivus is super intuitive and simple to use 
 
2x Faster modellingNo need for tools for clean-up, slicing and 360 degree images 
 
No riskNo setup costs and no maintenance for hardward and software 
 
Development with customersPerfectly integrated in today´s modelling workflow 
 
						Faster Cloud Processing					
						Extremely fast calculation

Frequently Asked Questions 
Process To Work
Upload your point cloud to our aurivus portal app.aurivus.com and let the magic happen. On average the AI data processing can take 30 minutes (depending on file size), afterwards you can start modelling in Revit. **Take a seat and have a coffee**
How Long It Works
On average the AI data processing can take 30 minutes, larger files can take 1 hour.*Maybe 2 coffees*
File Formats
Please upload your point cloud as E57 and ReCap RCP.  Structured or unstructured doesn’t matter but we recommend unstructured.Did you know that in some cases you can reduce the point cloud file size from 300 GB to 10 GB using unified RCP export? We recommend to export a unified RCP project with 5mm point distance. Zip the rcp file with the support folder for your upload.
Which Scanners do you support
We support all Laser Scanners or Lidar Systems. (Also iPad Pro or iPhone scanners)
