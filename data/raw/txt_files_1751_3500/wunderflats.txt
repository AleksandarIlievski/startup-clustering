According to the experience of our Wunderflats landlords/-ladies, the costs of different consumer behavior balance out well over several tenants. Only in case of significantly higher consumption, an additional payment might be due, which can be offset against the security deposit.What is the Housing support initiative for Ukraine?Wunderflats started this housing initiative with the aim of activating available housing for displaced Ukrainians and making it available to them - if possible free of charge or at very low rents. The rent is set by the landlords/-ladies. The use of the Wunderflats platform for this initiative is free of charge for all participants. Here is the link for the housing initiative from Wunderflats.View allRated excellent by our customersTrustpilotWork with usRent out your apartment successfully with WunderflatsBecome a Wunderflats
