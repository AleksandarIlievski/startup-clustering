Latest News – Lindis Initiates Clinical EU Certification Study REMOVE with CATUVAB®A Targeted Approach
Blood Transfusions (BT) are necessary when a patient loses more than 0.5 liters of blood.and the haematocrit becomes low in a surgical procedure.  Intraoperative Blood Salvage (IBS) is a technique frequently used during surgeries that have a greater potential for large blood volume loss to reduce or avoid allogeneic red blood cell transfusions along with their associated risks and costs. As blood becomes more and more a rare commodity, surgeries are increasingly cancelled due to a lack of available matched blood.
Main benefits of Autologous Salvaged Blood for patients and physicians are:
does not result in immunological challenges and associated safety issues,
provides a higher quality of red blood cells
avoids the risk of acquired virus infections due to test failures or untested virus species and
is immediately available
Blood salvage and transfusion is common in major surgeries but currently not in oncological surgeries, due to cancer cells that can be found in the intraoperative blood.

Risk Reduction for Tumor Patients and Physicians
0%No risk of transfusion reactions due to incompatibility e.g. TRALI (transfusion related acute lung injury)
0%No risk of transmitted disease, such as Hepatitis, CMV, HIV, etc.
0%No downregulation of patients’ immune system
Our Solution
Lindis Blood Care processes cancer patient´s wound blood for re-transfusion. We are developing a medical device, CATUVAB®
The CATUVAB® device removes cancer cells from the intraoperative blood during oncological surgeries and – as a result – makes Autologous Blood Transfusion safe and possible.
We use our patented technology based on a trifunctional antibody and technical equipment that is currently available at nearly all hospitals.
CATUVAB®
First device to remove reliably cancer 
cells from surgical shed blood
The CATUVAB® kit is a breakthrough
medical device designed to
Induce tumor cell/ lymphocyte complexes by a trifunctional antibody
Filter remove those complexes using an IBS procedure
Equipment already available in most hospitals
Enable re-transfusion of tumor cell depleted intraoperative blood to the patient

Benefits of Autologous Blood Salvage over allogeneic blood:
The patient’s blood is instantly available for re-infusion
No immunosuppression due to allogeneic blood/ erythrocytes reduced incidence of postoperative infections
No cross matching of blood types required and mistransfusion is eliminated
Based on literature data, LBC expects a potential to increase chance of prolonged relapse free – and overall survival time of cancer patients
Pharmacoeconomics
Cost-effective compared to fully burdened allogeneic blood transfusion
No costs for treatment of the possible severe side effects associated with allogeneic blood transfusions
