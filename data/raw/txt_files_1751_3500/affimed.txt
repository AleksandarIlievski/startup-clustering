A one-of-a-kind approach for revolutionary outcomes
We are revolutionizing cancer treatment by activatingthe untapped power of the innate
immune system to eradicate tumors. Our novel and proprietary technology binds NK cells and other innate immune cells directly to tumor cells, allowing for tumor destruction. This approach  is versatile and scalable. 
Our approach is differentiated and IP-protected, and has the promise to help patients who
have already undergone earlier lines of therapy that proved to be unsuccessful.
Partnerships poised to change the treatment landscape
We have entered select partnerships with esteemed pharmaceutical companies who share our passion for bringing change to the treatment of cancer.
The power to change patients’ lives
We trust that we can help those who have been left behind due to a lack of efficacy or unpredictable toxicity with traditional therapies. Clinical results already light the way for patients suffering from multiple types of cancer. Initial reported data have demonstrated unprecedented ORR in patients who had undergone earlier lines of therapy that proved to be unsuccessful—including one patient who was about to enter hospice care.
Now is your chance to be part of the next revolution in cancer treatment. Join us.PUBLICATIONS AND POSTERS
