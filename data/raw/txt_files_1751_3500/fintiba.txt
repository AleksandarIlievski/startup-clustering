Here’s what our students think about our service
             EXCELLENT  Based on 799 reviews                 MARIANA GAITAN VERANO  2022-07-01    Fintiba was my ally to open my blocked account and to be able to study in Germany, they always had the best attitude and willingness to help me when I needed to solve a doubt or problem (highlighting that the time in which they respond is ideal, they do not take more than 3 days).
The process to open the account was very easy and simple thanks to the app that is easy to understand and use for the user, the payments are on time and the whole documentation process was easy and fast.
I just have to say that I fully recommend Fintiba when opening a blocked account if I go back to Germany (which is very likely) I would not think twice when choosing my best ally.            Mohsin khan  2022-06-30    Fintiba is the best service provider for all students blocked account I get my documents easily for visa and I don't have done anything for my documents they just uploaded it.
