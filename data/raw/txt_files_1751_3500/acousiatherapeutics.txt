Mission 
Making hearing loss treatable for the millions affected 
 
 Hearing loss is a rapidly growing medical challenge. Right now, 1.5 billion around the globe are affected. According to WHO, this figure will rise to 2.5 billion by 2050. For those affected, limitation or loss of communication and social interaction have a strong impact on their health and quality of life. The implications include cognitive impairment, social isolation, mental health issues, and an increased risk of early dementia.2 For direct and indirect hearing loss related costs, there is an estimated global expense of USD 980 billion each year.1To date, no medications have been approved for the treatment of the various forms of hearing loss that would overcome the technical limitations of hearing aids and cochlear implants. Acousia develops novel compounds (small molecules) to improve and preserve natural hearing in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), thereby addressing a clear unmet medical need. SNHL affects over 90 percent of hearing loss patients. The unique dual mode of action of Acousia’s treatment candidates opens the possibility to both enhance hearing and prevent further loss.

Approach 
Small molecule therapeutics enhance and preserve natural hearing in SNHL 
90 percent of all hearing loss is attributed to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which is the result of damage to the sensory hair cells located in the cochlea, which is in the inner ear and is responsible for transmitting electrical signals to our auditory nerve cells. The other 10 percent, so-called conductive hearing loss (CHL), is caused by damage to the middle and outer ear and can be addressed by surgery, medication, or hearing devices.At Acousia, our focus is on SNHL. We develop small molecule drug candidates with a dual mode of action that is suitable for both acute and chronic hearing loss and strives to enhance and preserve a patient’s remaining natural hearing ability. We envision our therapeutic approach as a first-line stand-alone treatment as well as a complementary, synergistic form of therapy alongside hearing aids and cochlear implants (CI). Specifically, they would serve to add enhanced clarity of speech and sound perception to the device-based amplification.

First-in-man clinical study of ACOU0085 in patients with age-related hearing loss 
Acousia is developing a series of small molecule drug candidates for local and systemic administration for different forms of hearing loss. While the first ACOU085 clinical study in patients with age-related hearing loss started in January 2022, next generation drug candidates are being thoroughly characterized in a range of both specialized and standard preclinical models and assays.
