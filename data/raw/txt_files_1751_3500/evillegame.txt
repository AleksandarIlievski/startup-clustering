Multiplayer Deception madness
Whether you're one of the good guys or the bad guys, no one knows but you. Trick and convince others to stay alive!

Unveil the Conspirators! 
							
Every day you get to vote for any suspects and execute them. Villagers or conspirators win, depending on who is left at the end.

Gameplay Overview
A mysterious murder took place in the once peaceful village of Eville.
Each day villagers decide on a suspect and execute it until all evil-doers were found. Each night however the conspirators gather and decide to murder another innocent villager until they take over the village.
