HALERIUM PROJECTS
CASE STUDIES & PROJECTS WITH HALERIUM 
PROJECT  BMW
Until now, rework was standard practice in car door positioning, but it does not work with carbon parts. AI-updated positions could avoid rework, but black-box machine learning needs to much training data.
With Halerium the engineers‘ domain knowledge is included in the modeling to get optimal positions with little training data. In effect scrap cars are avoided, the process is saved.
PROJECT  FRAUNHOFER/SKZ
In the ProBayes research project Fraunhofer IPA and SKZ optimize an injection molding process with Bayesian networks. Without Halerium the interdisciplinarity of this project required a variety of tools causing a fragmented work-flow with lots of overhead.
Halerium allows the project team to unify their tools onto one platform, consolidate their knowledge, and expand on causal modelling projects.
PROJECT  HAHN DIGITAL
The Hahn Group aspires to integrate AI applications into their products. Each product is a highly specialized component that requires its own model. Without Halerium the development effort per product would be prohibite for the desired ROI.
With Halerium the engineers create and adapt the needed models themselves. This allows Hahn to cost-efficiently provide analytics solutions to their customers.

Erium team:   the experience behind Halerium  
Halerium is a product from data scientists that want to empower everyone to get insights from data. We have built the platform as a consequence of the experiences we gathered solving a myriad of data science challenges in industrial companies.
These learnings are not just ingrained into our data scientists, they are the foundation of Halerium.
Let's talk about your roadmap
Let’s start strategizing, prototyping, scaling and getting data analytics into your company.
