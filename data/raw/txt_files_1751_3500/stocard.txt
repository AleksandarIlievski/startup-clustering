So handy having all my cards stored on my phone, especially as I don't always have my handbag with me. It's less clutter for me.

Very good app. When you get close to shops registered in the app, it will suggest the card for a faster use.

Really useful. Was struggling to find a little-used card in my wallet. The assistant suggested this app and I've not looked back.
