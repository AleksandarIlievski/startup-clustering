Pioneering Intracellular Antibodies
We discover and develop breakthrough intrabodies (antibodies for intracellular targets) to give patients with poor or no treatment options new hope. We link single domain antibodies (nanobodies) together with advancements in drug delivery (using mRNA/LNP systems) to create a proprietary platform capable of producing breakthrough medicines.Mermaid Bio is a biotechnology company at the preclinical stage. We have a big vision and the experience and drive to fulfil it.
10 times the targets, 10 times the benefit
Using conventional drug modalities, to this day only about 20% of the known protein targets are “druggable”. Antibodies have revolutionised medicine and changed the lives of millions, but their success has been limited to the extracellular space. However, most diseases develop inside the cell. Mermaid Bio is focused on treating diseases inside cells, using advanced technologies to reach intracellular targets. We take antibodies deep below the surface to open up an ocean of opportunities inside the cell. We aim to transform patients lives with a next generation class of antibody-medicines.
