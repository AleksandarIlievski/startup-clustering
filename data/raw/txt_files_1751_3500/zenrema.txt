Enterprise Resource Management
Due to outsourcing, age-related retirement of employees and thus the know-how carriers, lack of junior staff, etc., the available time of internal employees for regular monitoring and constant optimization of the existing hardware and software resources in combination with the quite recurring changes in the workload mix fails.
We combine over 100 years of experience in z/OS, the z/OS subsystems and their fields of application.
Our specialties include performance in workload management as well as detailed analysis and optimization of your WLM policies, IBM pricing, capacity planning, hardware upgrades but not limited to these.
