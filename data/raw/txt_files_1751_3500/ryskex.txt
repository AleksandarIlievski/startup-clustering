PARAMETRIC RISK TRADING
 
TOMORROW’S SOLUTIONS ALREADY TODAY
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our present
 
We live in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world. That means ever more unpredictable risks occurring more often and with greater severity, resulting in untold damage for companies and individuals, both financially and reputationally. These corporate risks range from terrorism and cyber attacks, and financial crashes to natural catastrophes, and, in the most extreme cases, black swan events such as Covid-19. But the problem is that because they are hard to price accurately, it is often difficult to find viable coverage.
 
 
 
 
Finding a solution
 
Due to the way it is designed to calculate risk based on historic data, traditional insurance isn’t always the best answer. And because only 45-55% of insurance premiums are put towards claims reserves, often you don’t get the most from your coverage. That is where Ryskex can help. Our digital platform allows a global network of leading investors to take on these hard to insure emerging and systemic risks. It also enables insureds to find the appropriate coverage using our parametric risk transfer solution and hedge their risks as securitised intangible assets, which can be traded transparently and securely using blockchain technology. What’s more, the administrative costs are minimal.
 
 
 
 
Key advantages
 
 
 
New ecosystem
 
 
 
Our new ecosystem connects Fortune 500 companies and re/insurers with leading capital market investors. This allows their risks to be traded as a securitised intangible asset. It also gives them greater liquidity and financial power, and means less regulatory burden.
 
 
 
 
 
Blockchain technology
 
 
 
Our Quorum blockchain technology developed by JP Morgan provides greater oversight and efficiency of contract and claims regulation. Use of internal currency tokens also makes transactions simpler. An automated claims process and smart contracts ensure improved agreement and transaction security, claims verification, trust and reliability. And because we handle all claims, the middle man is cut out, making the process much quicker.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Parametric solution
 
 
 
The parametric solution uses artificial intelligence to forecast and define the effect of a risk, and ensures that claims are only triggered if it is proved that an event actually happened, as verified by an independent source. Such parameters include rainfall volume or seismic intensity. Our transparent and database-led framework also allows for greater claims objectivity, contract clarity and faster payouts.
 
 
 
 
 
Administration costs
 
 
 
Administration costs can be reduced to just five percent of the trading price/premium by combining digitisation and parametric risk transfer. Overall, savings of 45% on administration, reinsurance and broker fees can be achieved. There are also no hidden costs involved.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk value
 
 
 
Currently 80% of the value of a risk is accounted for by securitised intangible assets, of which only 16% are insured. Our aim is to eventually cover 100% of these intangible assets.
