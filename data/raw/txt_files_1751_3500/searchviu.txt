Nick Avé
General Manager, Just Amazing BV
„I’ve been happily using searchVIU since beta and it’s helped me do the work of a small team when it comes to large-scale SEO data collection and automation – an invaluable benefit to my business.
The platform and its DataStudio report connectors have helped with migrating, auditing and improving the organic performance of some highly complex international websites and it’s something I’m proud to have in my toolset as I strive to deliver only the very best results for my clients.
The team (Michael and Eoghan) are always on hand to offer expert support in a friendly and timely manner and to talk me through the regular updates and feature improvements, for which I’m eternally grateful. searchVIU has revolutionized the provision of SEO data warehousing, cloud-based crawling and optimization opportunities and I can’t recommend it highly enough to anyone serious about investing in a simple solution to managing complicated workflows.”
Luke Fitzgerald
Digital Marketing Consultant, RightFitz
„The searchVIU solutions have supported us optimally with a complex relaunch (changes of domain, protocol and contents) as well as after that with further optimizations.
Not only have I been convinced by the swift and straightforward processing, but even more so by the profound interpretation of the results and the resulting tips and instructions.
Definitely recommended!”
