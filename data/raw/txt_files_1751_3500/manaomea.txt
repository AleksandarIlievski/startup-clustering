 Vibrant new life for discarded textiles by turning them into the most beautiful, individual and authentic material. A social-ecological business and shining movement about to conquer the world with love, joy, passion, a visionary spirit, technology from space, playfulness and a dose of craziness. 
 
a textile fairytale 
on the way to a global movement 
 
»shadow&light« 
the first collection 
 
»better pens« 
custom-made, casual, extraordinary 
The life and soul of manaomea consists of 3 hearts beating together to form a unique start-up and a movement: A novel and versatile material, a manufactory for design products and a global social business.manaomeas material, its core, is made from handpicked textile remnants, natural fibers and its signature organic resin. Based on this innovative material, manaomea creates custom-made furniture, interior design and messenger pens in an intuitive way, embodying textiles authentic structure and story and expressing their beauty tangibly. 
The result is fascinating, bespoke and unique at every single millimeter. A very sensual experience. Not two of the lovingly manufactured pieces are alike. Each one radiates its own distinct energy and tells a different story.A story waiting to be continued by people who share our vision.

do you have a moment for some more beautiful lines? 
Our atmosphere is thin and delicate, in constant motion, and hitherto unique. When seen from space, its fragility is apparent. It is what we breathe – and where we live. The abundance of life forms and day-to-day activities it contains are myriad. Each individual activity is integral to the entire system and has an effect.Every decision to create a new product or develop a concept changes the system in its own distinctive way. Manaomea wants to change the world for the better: Our mission starts with a new material to create products that have their own story. A material from which new houses can be built, which leads to conversations, and which inspires joy.A material that creates products which fundamentally connect people and instill a sense of responsibility toward our planet: to keep this natural system healthy, species-rich and alive. Manaomea’s products are messengers of an intuitive way forward. They stand for beauty, sustainability and the future we all desire. 
For ideas are magic, and the impetus behind every process culminates in a created work that becomes a part of our world, preferably created in a sustainable way and reflecting the highest principles. After many years of experience in the aerospace industry, we are channeling our patented technology and our know-how into the creation of viable products.We have started with a collection »shadow&light«, design furniture and noble pens, made from handpicked textile remnants, recycled yarn, natural fibers and our signature organic resin. Each is natural and one of a kind, an alchemic transmutation from waste to treasure, ready to write wondrous tales: So that tools can be a treat to use; so that people can work under fair conditions; so that even better ideas can evolve; and so that breathing clean air never becomes a luxury.
