How it works 
Create a frictionless customer experience 
In addition to capturing customer data, collecting feedback or enrolling into the loyalty program, there are many sector-specific benefits of using refive. 
 
When a new customer opens their digital receipt, an anonymous customer profile is created in refive. 
 
The purchase data for this customer will be associated with their profile.
 
 
Each time the customer clicks on an offer, or uses a special discount and purchases again from your business, refive will connect this behavioural and purchase data to their customer profile, enhancing your insights.
