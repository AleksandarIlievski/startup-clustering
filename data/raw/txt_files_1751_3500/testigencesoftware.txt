TPT: Test and verify embedded control software. 
TPT is the user-friendly tool suite for functional testing of embedded control software. With TPT test cases can be modeled graphically or generated automatically, for example from Simulink models or from C-code. Even complex tests are easy to model and to maintain. TPT assists you with creating appropriate assessment rules to evaluate your test results. TPT generates test reports, links tests with requirements, interacts with tons of development tools, handles safety standards and much, much more. 
 
More about TPT
TPT: There is something for everyone. 
 
Our test tool TPT is a clever, fully integrated testing solution. We designed TPT to be the best testing solution that supports you from early test levels (MiL, SiL) to system integration (HiL, ViL). You don’t have to adapt your test processes, because TPT adapts to your needs. Just choose the ingredients of your taste.
