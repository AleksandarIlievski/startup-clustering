                    We can provide you with API’s allowing easy data transition to the platform.
                Decentralized data entry
                    Suppliers get log-in data to their own surface of the platform and enter their data, which saves you time.
                Selective transparency
                    The owner of the data decides what information to share with partners and consumers. While you see all your data in the system, your partners see only parts of it. Thus, no one runs the risk to be cut out of the supply chain.

FAQFrequently asked questionsWhy do you use blockchain?Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that allows us to ensure trust between suppliers and buyers, as blockchain does not allow any manipulation of data. This is the main reason why we decided to integrate blockchain technology (Ethereum).I have heard that blockchain is needing a lot of energy to run, is this true?Many people mistake blockchain for bitcoins. Bitcoin is a part of blockchain like E-Mail is a part of the internet. Bitcoin indeed needs a lot of energy. Ethereum on the other side is only needing a very small part of what Bitcoin needs to run transactions. Soon this will be even smaller once the transformation from Ethereum 1.0 (Proof of Work) to Ethereum 2.0 (Proof of Stake)Why do you use a public blockchain and what are the advantages in comparison with a private blockchain?Technological developments such as public blockchain make it possible to provide information across systems in a trustworthy and non-manipulable manner. This principle helps to link private systems (like private blockchains) interoperable through a decentralized and independent entity. In particular, for permissionless information about sustainability along global multi-tier supply chains, public blockchain makes this information 24h/7d and 100% available, readable provided without any additional running costs.I do not want to disclose my data and I am afraid to be bypassed in the supply chain by the buyer.The person entering the data is the owner of the data. The owner of the data alone decides what information to share with customers, consumers, and partners.In which ways does the AFTS solution save me resources?Companies can be onboarded quickly so that product routes and tracking can be started immediately – You save time.Relevant data is presented in a centralized way in one system only, for all departments, saving time for searching and duplicating Excel sheets.The solution enables strategic supply chain optimization, which allows cost savings in purchasing and protection against fines.The decentralized collection of data (input by suppliers) allows time savings for your employees.What stands AFTS for?AFTS stands for “Assured Farm to shelf” and expresses the founding idea: We want to enable companies to trace their products from their source, the farm, to the end product which consumers can find on the shelves. By doing this we allow companies to get to know their products and resources better, optimize them towards sustainability and human rights and share their story with their consumers through our consumer app.What do I need to be able to use the AFTS platform?First of all, please feel free to get into contact with us for a demo version anytime you want!
