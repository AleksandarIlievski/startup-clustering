ADDITIVE ANALYSISIdentify parts for Additive ManufacturingUnsure which parts are suitable for Additive Manufacturing? Werk24 automatically assesses the suitability of Drawings with regards to a range of Additive Technologies✅ Extract Outer Dimensions (often a limiting factor)✅ Extract tight tolerances (often require a subsequent milling step or favor CNC) ✅ Prioritize parts based on AM feasibilities of the chosen AM methods✅ Suggest alternative AM methods or extra milling steps↳ Learn More
  
FEASIBILITY ANALYSISAutomatically filter in-coming RFQsReceiving RFQs that don’t match your machines?Our AI reads Drawings and checks whether the parts match your manufacturing constraints. ✅ Extract production limiting factors incl., smallest Tolerances, smallest Thread diameter, smallest Radius, smallest GD&T✅ Integrate customized filtering logic✅ Convert a wide range of steel standards to EN10027 material codes and filter against a list of supported material ↳ Learn More
  
PMI EXTRACTIONDetect critical factors for production or pricing Your online quoting system requires manual entry of PMI from technical drawings? Werk24 extracts all relevant PMI.✅ Material✅ General Tolerances✅ Tolerances & Fits✅ Threads✅ GD&T↳ Learn More
 
 
Technical capabilitiesWerk24's TechRead API utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to extract key information locked in scanned Technical Drawings. Unlike traditional OCR solutions, our technology can understand great amount of contextual information and convert it into structured and searchable digital repositories.
 
Access Title BlockWerk24’s API reads the non-standardized Title Block and translates its content into a structured machine-readable format. Unlike OCR, Werk24’s AI interprets the content even when captions are missing or located in another cell. 
Extract MeasuresWerk24’s AI extracts Measures and converts them into a standard data structure, allowing direct access to Nominal Size, Tolerance (Fit & Deviation), Thread and Chamfer information. It’s way beyond traditional OCR solutions that only returns unstructured Strings.
Capture GD&TsOur API captures the full range of Geometric Dimensioning and Toleration (GD&T) frames on drawings and returns them in a standard data model. You can directly access the characteristic, toleration and reference data. 
Create ThumbnailsSeparating Sectional Views can be challenging, especially when they are positioned very close to one another. TechRead API separates them and generates thumbnails for individual Sectionals, as well as the whole drawing.
