The cooperation with ShowHeroes is characterized by mutual trust, a high degree of flexibility and a very good technical setup.
 
The exchange with our contacts is always transparent and at eye level. Working in that kind of partnership is highly productive.
 
From SPIEGEL Media’s point of view, this very fact, coupled with the corresponding marketing revenues make for a good long-term partnership.
 
In short: the cooperation with ShowHeroes is a success story.

Philip Schadewald
Head of  Programmatic Advertising
ShowHeroes is a pillar of our programmatic purchasing since 2019: Throughout all campaigns, good KPIs were achieved and increased through the very close exchange within the partnership. Thus ShowHeroes is one of the absolute top performers in terms of viewability. We enjoy working with ShowHeroes. They can handle many video campaigns at the same time on a high-performance level, the reaction time of our contact persons is high and the troubleshooting is done proactively and at eye level. After such a promising start in 2019, we are very much looking forward to working together in 2020.
