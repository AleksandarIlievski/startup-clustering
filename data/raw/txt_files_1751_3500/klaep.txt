We want them to have full rights of their collaborations (equal royalties) and want to give them the benefit to earn money and to connect with their audience in the best possible way.#3We stand up for the fair treatment of creative works! Every cover song will be detected and remunerated to the respective authors.#4We will do everything in our power to comply with European data protection and categorically do not sell data to third-party providers. The data will always remain with us!#5Last but not least we are building this platform as musicians ourselves and want to create a fair-to-use and for all creatives beneficial social music collaboration app. No bullshitting granted!NewsletterSTAY UP-TO-DATEJoin our email newsletter and get access to specials deals exclusive to our subscribers.
