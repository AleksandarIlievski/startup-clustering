OUR TEAM Variowell Development is the European pioneer in developing technologies for a positive sleep experience. With our international partners, from well-known chemical companies to leading mattress brands worldwide, we have been actively co-operating on the development and delivery of technology-steered components for the mattress industry.Although Variowell has been active on the market for over 10 years, we are still very much a start-up company with an agile team-spirit. Our team consists of a diverse group of developers, engineers, and experts to ensure that we deliver the best product possible to our customers.OUR CAPABILITIESWe use state-of-the-art digital tools and methods to create and optimize new materials. From overnight testing for valuable real-life data to precise analysis and computing of the flow of thermal energy in PU-foams: Variowell uses its capabilities to build deep insights into what actually happens overnight in mattresses, pillows or toppers.Software will find its place to improve the sleep experience of consumers. But consumers globally demand seamless solutions – the bed should not be another device to be taken care of regularly. Look out for what comes next!THERMAL COMFORTFoam mattresses are made from insulating materials. This means the thermal energy your body releases accumulates in the foam overnight. Our innovative technology helps this excess heat flow away through natural cooling. That’s why our technology works non-stop in all conditions, all year round. FIRMNESS CHANGEOur goal is to make sleep as comfortable as possible without the hassle of extra effort on your side. The manufacturers integrate our modules into the mattress; these modules change the firmness of the bed during sleep. The changes are so smooth that the user does not even detect them. Feel the difference but not the change!PRODUCTSDo you wish to experience better sleep? Check out our products that will fulfill all your needs.
