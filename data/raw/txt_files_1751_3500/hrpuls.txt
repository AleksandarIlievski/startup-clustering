FAQ - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Can the software be adapted to my needs? 
HRpuls is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution. Neither installation nor integration of the IT is necessary. Updates and maintenance of the system are fully automatic. Technical interfaces can be created for existing systems (e.g. SAP). The software can be implemented quickly and easily.
What service packages are available? 
HRpuls products are of modular design. These modules can be grouped into three suites, each optimized for one target group (recruiting, HR management, performance).
You can choose between the basic and the premium package. 
The basic rate includes the one-time onboarding and technical provision. The software is operated by self-service by the customer. The premium offer also includes individual advice from HR experts and psychologists on a wide range of topics such as setting goals, constructing questionnaires, identifying critical topics or implementing ideas.
How is data protection guaranteed? 
Our web hosting partner is 1&1 Internet SE with server locations exclusively in Germany. With our data protection concept we meet the requirements...
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to be applied as of 25.05.2018
of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG (new)))
according to § 64 sentence 1 of the BDSG (new) to guarantee technical and/or organisational measures (TOM) to ensure security and protection requirements of the BDSG (new)
according to § 62 BDSG (new) for order processing
