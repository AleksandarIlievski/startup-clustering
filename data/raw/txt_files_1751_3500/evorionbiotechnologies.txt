Cellular communication matters in vivo.So why shouldn’t it in vitro?
Quantifying biological parameters in a population of cells obscures critical insights into how neighboring cells in a microenvironment influence function, particularly in heterogeneous samples. You can reveal these obscured interactions by performing single-cell measurements on a massively parallel platform.
CellCity is a unique microfluidics concept, which was developed for the analysis of live cells. It documents the actions of thousands of cells and cell pairs in a defined arrangement and environment at single-cell resolution. It allows you to control cell proximity in order to elucidate cell-cell interactions and track phenotype changes over time and space. Explore new frontiers in cell-based biomedical research. That is the transformative power of CellCity.
CELL INTERACTION ANALYSIS
Co-position cells to study hundreds of interactions simultaneously.
 
FUNCTIONAL PHENOMICS
Link changing functional phenotypes to underlying genotypes.
 
IN-DEPTH POPULATION STUDIES
Reveal how cells function in a physiologically accurate context.

About Functional Phenomics
This unique workflow links a single cell‘s functional phenotype with multi-omics data thereby developing knowledge for new breakthroughs in cell therapy development.
Current single-cell multi-omics technologies fail to directly link a single cell’s multi-omics data to changes in its functional phenotype over time. This is where our innovative workflow excels. We enable to simultaneously analyze multiple phenotypes (cellular functions, intracellular protein expression, surface and secreted protein profiles), the cellular interactions of thousands of cells in highly parallelized manner and to link those insights directly to each cell’s underlying genetic and transcriptional makeup by retrieving specific cells of your interest from our CellCity Array Chip.

Step 1
 
Cell encapsulation:
Encapsulate individual, pairs, or groups of cells in a gel bead which acts as a protective and diffusible microenvironment. Work with a range of cell sizes, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.
Step 2
 
Gel bead trapping:
Immobilize up to 2000 cell-laden gel beads in microfluidic traps on the CellCity Array Chip in order to form an array in which each gel bead is uniquely identified by its precisely defined position.
Step 3
 
Cell CULTURE:
Culture cells under tightly controlled conditions with the optional ability to stimulate cells. Monitor cell behaviour and function using time-lapse microscopy.
Step 4
 
Cell ANALYSIS:
Couple endpoint measurements with time-lapse data, while simultaneously capturing the responses of single cells in multiparametic analysis, such as time-lapse fluorescent imaging and immunohistochemistry.
Step 5
 
CELL RETRIEVAL:
Easily retrieve the gel beads in which the cells are contained for subsequent downstream analysis or cell expansion.

The workflow of CellCity is akin to the busy streets of any big city around the world, where we all meet, interact, observe, and change with the influence of the people we meet, the experiences we share, and the impacts we have on each other.

The Software – The Brain – The Incubator – The Array Chip
Precision engineering makes CellCity a powerful analysis tool enabling functional phenomics, but its smart design is what makes it a seamless experience for the user. With its plug-and-play format, carefully planned components, and easy portability, the entire system can easily plug right into any inverted imaging system, lab setup, or study routine.
◉CELLCITY SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
User-friendly, proprietary PC-software communicates with the CellCity Control Unit to regulate and perform all essential workflow steps. Also, it helps researchers to minimize experimental steps and accelerate analyses in real-time.
Built-in performance-checks ensure reliable and accurate assay outcomes
Accelerates and simplifies workflows e.g. with cell counting and gel bead analysis tools
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based position selection tool: CellCity Scout-AI, automatically select hundreds of positions of interest on the CellCity Array Chip for time-lapse imaging
◉THE INCUBATORON YOUR INVERTED IMAGING SYSTEM
The CellCity Incubator holds the CellCity Array Chip and maintains the relevant experimental conditions for long-term, live-cell analysis.
A complete, miniature incubator (37°C, 5% CO₂). No need for any other chamber.
Designed in a microtiter plate format to fit on your inverted microscope setup.
Controlled and optimized heating to work with low volumes and temperature sensitive samples
The CellCity Incubator can be easily moved to a cell culture hood for uninterrupted sterile conditions and handling
◉THE CHIP
The CellCity Array Chip is a high-precision microfluidic device that places single, pairs and groups of cells into an array of gel beads for sterile culture and analysis. No microfluidics experience required
Cell-laden gel beads are captured in the 425 microfluidic double-traps of 4 microfluidic channels to analyze up to 3400 gel beads at a time
Accommodates different cell types and cell lines, in particular primary cells (e.g. HUVEC, breast cancer cells, brain tumors, CAR-T cells, macrophages, leukemia cells and even bacteria)
Includes a high-resolution temperature sensor integrated at the cell culture site exactly where the correct temperature is needed
Augments insights with endpoint data by making it easy to stain cells (e.g., immunostaining, surface staining) after time-lapse (fluorescent) imaging
◉THE BRAINCONTROL UNIT
The CellCity Control Unit automates all workflow steps essential for reliable cell culture and analysis and executes the experimental design through integrated control software.
Powerful and fast, traps thousands of cell-laden gel beads on a CellCity Array Chip within a few minutes
Light-weight, easily portable and designed for a quick plug-and-play setup
Brings microfluidic cell culture to any lab (intuitive user experience, automated flow control and priming, bubble-free operation)
Precision engineering delivers uniform perfusion to ensure homogeneous culture conditions
