It has become an essential part of my workflow.

By accumulating all notifications in one place, Acapela makes sure that nothing slips past me.Graham PatersonConnect VenturesI absolutely hate comms tools that try to give you FOMO. Acapela lets me strategically catch up with things a few times a day, all at once. It stops me getting sucked in.Ognjen StefanovicCodaxyOne place for most work notifications is amazing. I used it to integrate with Figma and Jira, and those notifications are amazing to have in one place, and remove unnecessary emails.Manca GracarPovio LabsI just love using the Acapela app. Everything is in one place! I also had some Figma-related questions and the team is super helpful and responsiveStuart7BridgesSince using Acapela I know I’m not missing anything crucial and I can better control how and when I want to deal with notifications. In short, Acapela has revolutionised how I handle notifications. It’s brilliant!Take control of your work communicationWork shouldn't be about interruptions, FOMO, context switching, and firefighting.
