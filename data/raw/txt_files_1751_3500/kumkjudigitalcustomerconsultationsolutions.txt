Example of Challenges in the Trade
 
Consumers are not going to the store because of your products
Online shopping eliminates the need to buy a product in an offline store. This insight is important because it raises the question of what reason do you give your customers to visit your business? Think about to inspire your customers with exceptional service and the use of digital technology at the POS. The focus should be on creating clearly recognizable added value for your customers.
 
The way of using presentation areas in the stores plays a role
In particular, brick-and-mortar retailers are under pressure to come up with some ideas so that customers do not turn their backs on them. Starting with the area creation for eventful product presentations up to the use of various retail technologies –  the challenges of getting customers into stores are huge. 
 
Personal advice more important than ever
Quality advisory staff are not only expensive but also harder to find these days. But traders are relying on personal advice on-site for some good reasons. The use of digital signage solutions with live applications can save staff costs while providing personal advice for customers. The reputation of a store, the fun of shopping and even sales can be positively influenced by digital displays.
  
To master these challenges, profound changes are needed. This requires a fundamental rethinking.
Start with a professional concept
  
From Concept to Realization
With more than 15 years of retail marketing experience, we help retailers and manufacturers to use digital technologies such as digital signage solutions in trade. With a view from outside on your business, we can identify potential for improvement and fix possible weaknesses. Together with you we discuss which technology solves concrete problems at the POS or which is best suited to create a unique shopping experience for your customers.
From the initial conception to the complete implementation, we support companies in the digitization of the point of sale.
